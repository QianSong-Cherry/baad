"Sampling strategy","Sampling was conducted by Masahito Nishioka, Tohru Umehara, and Masahiro Nagano in June 1979 in a secondary forest at Mt. Minoh, Japan. All trees on the 10 m x 10 m sampling plot were cut at ground level (Nishioka et al. 1982). Stem diameter and tree height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-2.8 m, and at intervals of 1.5 m upward. Multiple-stemmed trees were excluded for this data paper."
"Leaf area","Projected leaf area was estimated from fresh mass of leaves and leaf area/leaf mass ratios obtained from subsamples (Nishioka et al. 1982). Subsamples were collected from each layer and each tree. Leaf area was measured by a photoelectric planimeter."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Measured by measuring tape."
"Biomass","Fresh mass of leaves, branches, and stem were measured separately for each layer and tree (Nishioka et al. 1982). A subsample of each organ was taken for each layer and each tree and oven-dried at 85 deg C for one week. The dry-to-fresh mass ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry mass of each tree component."
"Other variables","Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
"Year collected","1979"
