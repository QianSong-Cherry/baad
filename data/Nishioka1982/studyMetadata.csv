Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted by Masahito Nishioka, Tohru Umehara, and Masahiro Nagano. All trees on the 10 m × 10 m sampling plot were cut at ground level (Nishioka et al. 1982). Stem diameter and tree height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-2.8 m, and at intervals of 1.5 m upward."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was estimated from fresh weight of leaves and leaf area/leaf weight ratios obtained from subsamples (Nishioka et al. 1982)."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured by measuring tape."
Biomass,"Fresh weights of leaves, branches and stem were measured separately for each layer and tree (Nishioka et al. 1982). Subsamples of each organ were taken and oven-dried at 85oC for one week. The dry-to-fresh weight ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry weight of each tree component."
Other variables,"Species name and family names according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
