\underline{Species}: Beilschmiedia tarairi, Beilschmiedia tawa, Dysoxylum spectabile, Elaeocarpus dentatus, Griselinia littoralis, Knightia excelsa, Laurelia novaezelandiae, Litsea calicaris, Melicytus ramiflorus, Metrosideros umbellata, Nestegis cunninghamii, Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides, Nothofagus menziesii, Nothofagus truncata, Vitex lucens, Weinmannia racemosa, Weinmannia silvicola.

\underline{Sampling strategy}: We obtained 200 Ã± 350 mm tall seedlings from commercial sources and grew them in a glasshouse for 105 days. Crown architecture of each seedling was recorded using a using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). YPCONVERT, developed by Daniel Falster, was used to convert architecture files to a format compatible with YPLANT.

\underline{Leaf area}: The total foliage area of each plant was measured using a LI-3100 leaf Area Meter

\underline{Stem cross sectional area}: Basal stem diameter (immediately above any root flanges) was measured on two orthogonal axis, using electronic callipers.

\underline{Height}: Height was measured as the length of the longest stem, from the ground to the  apex.

\underline{Crown area}: Crown area was computed from the plant architecture data obtained using the 3D digitizer.

\underline{Biomass}: Only aboveground biomass was harvested. Plants were divided into stem and leaf fractions and then dried to a constant weight. Petioles of simple leaves were included in total leaf mass. Petioles of compound leaves were included in the stem fraction.

\underline{traits}: Note that only aboveground biomass was harvested.

\underline{Growth environment}: Nursery-sourced plants grown in glasshouse with ~ 20% light.

\underline{Other variables}: Relative growth rates of stem height and volume were measured. Transverse sections were taken from base of each stem to measure vessel diameters and densities. Theoretical sapwood conductivity was then computed from the xylem anatomy data. Actual measurements of sapwood conductivity were also carried out.
