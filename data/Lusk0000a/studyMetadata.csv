Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"We obtained 200 - 350 mm tall seedlings from Miranda Scenic Reserve (NZ) from second-growth stands and margins of warm-temperate rainforest. Crown architecture of each seedling was recorded using a using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia)."
Leaf area,The total foliage area of each plant was measured using a LI-3100 leaf Area Meter
Stem cross sectional area,"Basal stem diameter (immediately above any root flanges) was measured on two orthogonal axis, using electronic callipers."
Height,"Height was measured as the length of the longest stem, from the ground to the apex."
Crown area,Crown area was computed from the plant architecture data obtained using the 3D digitizer.
Biomass, "Plants were divided into stem, leaf and root fractions and then dried to a constant weight. Petioles of simple leaves were included in total leaf mass."
Growth environment,second-growth stands and margins of warm-temperate rainforest.
"Year collected","2006"
