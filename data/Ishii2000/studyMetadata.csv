Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Survey was conducted in June-August 1995 in a secondary broadleaved forest (60 m a.s.l.) dominated by Quercus such as Q. serrate and Q. variabilis (Ishii and Tadaki 2000). All trees in a 15 times 10 m plot were felled. Stem diameter at 0, 0.3, 1.3 m and at intervals of 1 m upward, tree height, height of the lowest living branch, height of lowest leaf, and crown diameter were measured. Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth. Fresh weights of stem, branches, leaves, and fruits in each layer were measured."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was estimated from subsamples (Ishii and Tadaki 2000)."
Height,"Measured after trees were felled (Ishii and Tadaki 2000)."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights (Ishii and Tadaki 2000). The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken from each layer."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
