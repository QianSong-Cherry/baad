"Sampling strategy","Sample trees were felled in two Quercus serrata secondary forests at Kouma Experimental Forest, Iwate, Japan in September of 1968 for stand 4 and of 1969 for stand 5. Trees were selected to represent size classes. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers and separated into stem, branches, leaves, and seeds."
"Leaf area","Total leaf area was estimated from fresh mass and the ratio of leaf area to fresh mass. Leaf area of 30 randomly sampled leaves was measured by the dot-counting method (Negishi et al. 1957 J. Jp. For. Soc. 39: 380-384)."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh mass was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken for each layer. For stem subsample, stem discs were collected. All subsamples were oven-dried at 80-85 deg. C."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Segawa and Kato (1969). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
