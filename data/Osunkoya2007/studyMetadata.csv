"Topic","Description"
"Sampling strategy"," All trees > 5 cm in diameter in a 1 ha permamant plot were sampled."
"Stem cross sectional area","Tree diameter at breast height determined, using diameter tapes."
"Height","Tree height determined using clinometers. Crown depth  is the difference between tree height and fork height. Fork height itself is defined as distance between the stem base and the lowest major brach"
"Crown area","Crown diameter  were measured in four directions, and crown projection area estimated as a function of tree fork and crown heights and crown width; see Osunkoya et al 2007 for details."
"Growth environment","Mixed dipterocarp rainforest."
"Year collected","2004"
"Acknowledgements","P. Becker initially set up the permanent plots used"
