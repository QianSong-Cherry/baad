Sampling strategy,"Sample trees were selected in two locations (800-1200 m a.s.l.) to represent wide diameter ranges in August 1962 (Ikushima 1964). After trees were felled, diameter at breast height and tree height were measured. Fresh weights of stem, branches, and leaves were measured. For several large-sized trees, fresh weights of stems were estimated from stem volume."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was estimated from subsamples (Ikushima 1964)."
Height,"Measured but not reported."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights (Ikushima 1964). The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken for each tree."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
