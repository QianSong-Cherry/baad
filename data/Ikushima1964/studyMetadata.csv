Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sample trees were selected in two locations (800-1200 m a.s.l.) to represent wide diameter ranges in August 1962 (Ikushima 1964). After trees were felled, diameter at breast height and tree height were measured."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was estimated from subsamples (Ikushima 1964)."
Height,"Measured but not reported."
Biomass," Fresh mass of stem, branches, and leaves were measured. Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass (Ikushima 1964). The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken for each tree. For several large-sized trees, fresh mass of stems were estimated from stem volume."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Ikushima (1964). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
