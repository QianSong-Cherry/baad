Questions about the study:  Wang2011 

1. Could you please indicate the status (in terms of shading) of your sampled stands? Please answer using one of the following categories: 0 = supressed, 1 = intermediate, 2 = codominant (crown partly exposed), 3 = dominant (crown fully exposed). We'd appreciate if you could ansewr in this file and return it to us.

2. Could you please provide a short description of the methods used to collect Leaf Area?
 
   >>A needle area is computed from its length L and diameter R based on the allometric relationship provided for Mongolian Scots pine.
S=2.57*R(L-0.1167)  (Jiao, 1982)
I random sampled more than 20 needles in the experiments. I didn't take the samples for each individual and didn't consider the position of leaves in the plant.
The specific leaf area can be fitted by leaves area and biomass of these samples. Finally, the Leaf Area was calculated by their biomass and specific leaf area.

3. Could you please provide a short description of the methods used to collect plant Height?
  >>Because trees are young, the heights of most samples are less than one meter. We directly measured the tree height by tape.

4. Could you please provide a short description of the methods used to collect plant Biomass? 
  >>Samples were taken for destructive measurements of biomass and geometry. To prevent water loss during measurement, plants were dug up with their roots and soil and transported to the laboratory.

5. What was the main vegetation type of your study? Please answer using one of the following categories: Sav = Savannah; TropRF = Tropical rainforest; TempRF = temperate rainforest; TropSF = Tropical seasonal forest; TempF = Temp forest; BorF = Boreal forest; Wo = Woodland; Gr = Grassland; Sh = Shrubland; De = Desert
