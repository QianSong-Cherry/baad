Can you please check the data you have on Total leaf dry mass, for plants of age 1? For these plants the ratio of dry to fresh mass is about 0.02, whereas in it is around 0.35-0.45 for the remaining plants. The latter value is much more realistic. 
For leaf area of conifers, was this measured as projected or all-sided (or half-all-sided) area?
