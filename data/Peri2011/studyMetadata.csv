Topic, Description
Sampling strategy, "Three plots (replicates) of 15 x 30 m were randomly located at each study area. Within each plot, five individuals, of dominant shrub corresponding to different sizes were randomly selected."
Leaf area, "Leaf area (LA) of each individual size was determined by scanning the total harvested leaves per plant. The leaves were spread randomly over a transparent sheet and then scanned using a flat-bed scanner. The leaf area was determined using image analysis software (DT-Scan, Delta-T Ltd., Cambridge, UK)."
Height, "Before harvesting height was measured with a tape."
Crown area, "Before harvesting, crown dimensions (the crown length at its widest point, CL; the perpendicular crown extent at the same height, CW) of each plant was measured. Crown area (CA) was calculated as CA = 3.1416 x CL/2 x CW/2."
Biomass, "Each plant was harvested during the spring growth period (November-December) corresponding to the vegetative growth peak and summer (January-February). Then, shrub plants were separated into the following components: green leaves; senesced leaves; twigs (1-2 years old); branches (> 2 years old) and roots classified as fine (diameter <1.0 mm), medium (1.0-5.0 mm) and coarse (> 5.0 mm) roots for biomass calculations and nutrient analysis. Roots from individual plants were excavated to maximum rooting depth for all size classes in circular plots centred on the base of selected plants. These roots were sorted in diameter class and weighed in fresh. Sub samples were taken for oven drying to estimate biomass."
Traits, "Samples of components were dried in a forced draft oven at 65oC to constant weight and ground in a mill containing 1 mm stainless steel screen for nutrient analysis. Nitrogen (N) content was determined using the semi-micro Kjeldahl technique."
Growth environment, "Junellia tridens shrub plants were collected from a shrub steppe with vegetation dominated by J. tridens (50-60%) associated with Jarava chrysophylla, Poa dusenii, Satureja darwinii and Nassauvia aculeata. Climate is cold temperate and subhumid with a mean annual temperature of 7.5oC, a long-term annual rainfall of 180 mm evenly distributed throughout the year and potential evapotranspiration ranges between 4 and 5 mm/d in summer. The predominant wind direction is from the south-southwest quarter. Severe and frequent windstorms occur in spring and summer, with windspeeds over 120 km/h. Soils were coarse textured classified as Molisols."
