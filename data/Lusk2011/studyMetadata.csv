Topic,"Description"
Sampling strategy,"This study was carried out in a 35-year-old second-growth forest fragment dominated by Nothofagus dombeyi, in Parque Nacional Puyehue, Chile (40∞39íS, 72∞11íW). The biomass distribution of juveniles (17ñ740 mm tall) of seven temperate rainforest evergreens growing in low (approx. 4 %) light in the understorey of a second-growth stand was quantified. Daytime and night-time gas exchange rates of leaves were also determined, and crown architecture was recorded using a using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). YPCONVERT, developed by Daniel Falster, was used to convert architecture files to a format compatible with YPLANT."
Leaf area,"The total foliage area of each plant was measured photographically."
Stem cross sectional area,"Basal stem diameter (immediately above any root flanges) was measured on two orthogonal axis, using electronic callipers."
Height,"Height was measured as the length of the longest stem, from the ground to the  apex."
Crown area,"Crown area was computed from the plant architecture data obtained using the 3D digitizer."
Biomass,"Saplings were divided into root, stem, and leaf fractions, and then dried to a constant weight. Leaf petioles were included in total leaf mass."
traits,"n/a."
Growth environment,"Field, wild."
Other variables,"Mean annual rainfall provided. Leaf lifespans of six of the seven species were estimated by monitoring leaf survival over 12 months. A Nikon Coolpix digital camera (Nikon Corporation, Japan) with a 182 degree fisheye adapter was used to take a hemispherical photograph directly above each seedling. Analysis of hemispherical photographs indicated that canopy openness above the selected seedlings ranged from 2.3% to 5.6%, including small but significant differences between species (P < 0.001). Since the aim of the present study was to compare species under standardized conditions, a composite light environment derived using canopy structure information obtained from analysing the set of 159 photographs taken above the seedlings was created (Falster and Westoby, 2003). This was equivalent to ca. 4.0% canopy openness."
