Stem, branches, and needles were separated."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. Detailed method not reported."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Yi et al. (1989). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese).
