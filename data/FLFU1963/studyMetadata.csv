"Sampling strategy","Sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class or all trees within a plot were felled. Usuda National Forest and Ueda National Forest were surveyed on 25 July to 13 August, 1961. Sumitomo Forestry Co. Forest (stand 6: elevation = 500 m a.s.l., upper slope; slope = 30 degree; stand 3: 200 m, lower slope; stand 7: near stand 6) was surveyed on 23 October to 1 November, 1961. Naeba was surveyed in September 1961. Sample trees were felled at the base, and diameter at breast height, tree height, height of the lowest living branch, and length of longest branch were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-2.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward. For conifer species, branches and leaves were separated into layers according to the height of whorl branch which branches and leaves are attached. Chiba Forest of Tokyo University was surveyed on 27 November to 2 December 1961 for aboveground and 13-15 December 1961 for root. Trees in this stand were 12-15 years old and regenerated naturally on a land formally used as forest tree nursery. Sample trees were cut into layers based on stem age. Branches and leaves within each layer were further separated based on their ages (current-year, one year, etc.). Only main roots were excavated and weighted. Multiple-stemmed trees were excluded for this data paper."
"Leaf area"," Leaf area was estimated for broadleaf species from fresh mass and leaf area per fresh mass which were obtained from a subsample (100-200 g in fresh mass) collected from several sampled trees at each stand."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Measured after sample trees were cut down (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1963)."
"Biomass","Fresh mass of components (stem, branches, and leaves) in each layer were measured. Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated for each stand and each component from a subsample (several hundreds to several thousands g) taken from several sampled trees."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases, digitized raw data, and created meta data based on the references (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1963; Kan et al. 1965 Bull. Kyoto. Univ. For. 37:55-75). Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
