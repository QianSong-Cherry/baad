"Sampling strategy","Sample trees were felled in a 4 year-old Quercus serrata plantation located in the compartment II-10 of the Tanashi Experimental Field, University of Tokyo (60 m a.s.l.) in November of 1978. Trees were planted in the spring of 1974. Density was ca. 6800 trees/ha in 1978. After measuring diameter and tree height, 12 trees representing each size class were selected. Sample trees were cut down at ground level and then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0.5 m depth and divided into stem, old branches, new branches, and leaves."
"Leaf area","Because Quercus serrata is a deciduous tree and the sampling was conducted in Autumn, leaf area and leaf biomass were assumed to be smaller as a representative value during the growing season. Leaf area of each layer was estimated for each tree from dry mass and the ratio of leaf area to mass. The ratio was obtained for each layer. Leaf area of subsample was measured with an automatic planimeter (Hayashi-Denko AAM-7)."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsample taken from each tree and each layer. Subsamples were oven-dried at 85 degC for more than 48 h."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Watanabe and Yagi (1985). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
