Topic, Description
Sampling strategy, "Fourteen representative trees of different diameter classes were felled to establish their aboveground biomass: seven Fagus sylvatica trees and seven Pinus sylvestris trees. Each tree thud hsrvested was divided into trunk, branches and leaves."
Leaf area, "Leaf area was not measured."
Stem cross sectional area,"The DBH of all trees in 1 ha surface  on each experimental plot was measured."
Height,"The height  of all trees in 1 ha surface was measured for each tree species using a measuring tape."
Biomass,"Tree compartments (trunk, branches and leaves) were partitioned and then dried at 80oC to be weighted. The trunks were separated into sections, according to their height (0-1.30 m, 1.30-3 m, 3-5 m, 5-7 m)."
Traits,"Representative biomass and litter samples were ground for chemical analyses. Total carbon and nitrogen were determined using a Wosthoff carmograph and Macro-N Heraeus analyzer, respectively."
Growth environment,"Individuals are naturally regenerated individuals in gaps or in the understory. The Fagus sylvatica is a climacic species, whereas  Pinus sylvestris is a disclimacic species."
