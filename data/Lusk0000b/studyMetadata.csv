Species,"Beilschmiedia tarairi, Beilschmiedia tawa, Dysoxylum spectabile, Elaeocarpus dentatus, Griselinia littoralis, Laurelia novaezelandiae, Litsea calicaris, Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides, Nothofagus menziesii, Vitex lucens, Weinmannia racemosa, Pseudopanax crassifolius, Scheflera digitata."
Sampling strategy,"We obtained 200 - 300 mm tall seedlings from commercial sources and grew them for varying periods (one week to two months) in a glasshouse."
Leaf area,"The total foliage area of each plant was measured using a LI-3100 leaf Area Meter"
Stem cross sectional area,"Basal stem diameter (immediately above any root flanges) was measured on two orthogonal axis, using electronic callipers."
Height,"Height was measured as the length of the longest stem, from the ground to the  apex."
Crown area,"n/a."
Biomass,"Plants were divided into root, stem and leaf fractions, and dried to a constant weight. Petioles of simple leaves were included in total leaf mass. Petioles of compound leaves were included in the stem fraction."
traits,"n/a."
Growth environment,"Nursery-sourced plants grown in glasshouse with ~ 20% light."
Other variables,"n/a."
