\underline{Species}: Beilschmiedia tarairi, Beilschmiedia tawa, Dysoxylum spectabile, Elaeocarpus dentatus, Griselinia littoralis, Laurelia novaezelandiae, Litsea calicaris, Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides, Nothofagus menziesii, Vitex lucens, Weinmannia racemosa, Pseudopanax crassifolius, Scheflera digitata.

\underline{Sampling strategy}: We obtained 200 - 300 mm tall seedlings from commercial sources and grew them for varying periods (one week to two months) in a glasshouse.

\underline{Leaf area}: The total foliage area of each plant was measured using a LI-3100 leaf Area Meter

\underline{Stem cross sectional area}: Basal stem diameter (immediately above any root flanges) was measured on two orthogonal axis, using electronic callipers.

\underline{Height}: Height was measured as the length of the longest stem, from the ground to the  apex.

\underline{Crown area}: n/a.

\underline{Biomass}: Plants were divided into root, stem and leaf fractions, and dried to a constant weight. Petioles of simple leaves were included in total leaf mass. Petioles of compound leaves were included in the stem fraction.

\underline{traits}: n/a.

\underline{Growth environment}: Nursery-sourced plants grown in glasshouse with ~ 20% light.

\underline{Other variables}: n/a.
