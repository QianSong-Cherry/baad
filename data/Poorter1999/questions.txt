You listed units for the variable a.lf (leaf area) as 'g' which is clearly wrong, we're guessing it it be m2 (the plots shown in the report use m2)?

There were two variables called total mass (m.to) in the spreadsheet you sent. The first looks to be correct (i.e. is sum of other variables) so we have used that. What is the second variable (now renamed to m.to2)?
