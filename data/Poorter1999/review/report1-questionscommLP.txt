	 If so, could you please review the original data file you provided us with and verify that all information is correct.
ANSWER: IN YOUR PLOT ON AREA OF INDIVIDUAL LEAF THERE ARE MANY WITH A LEAF AREA <1.10-4M2. THIS IS <1CM2, ISN'T IT? IN THE INITIAL DATASET THAT I PROVIDED A.ILF WAS EXPRESSED IN CM2, AND THERE WERE ONLY 4 INDIVIDUALS WITH AN INDIVIDUAL LEAF AREA OF 1CM2, AND NOTHING WITH LESS. SO MAYBE YOU OR I MADE A MISTAKE IN THE CONVERSION?

DF response: Actually there are a nine values between 0.3-1cm2 in the original file.

IN YOUR FILE POORTER1999.CSV THERE ARE TWO INDIVIDUALS WITH NEGATIVE CROWN DIAMETERS. PELASE REMOVE THOSE VALUES

DF response: done.

ANSWER: YES

11. You listed units for the variable a.lf (leaf area) as 'g' which is clearly wrong, we're guessing it it be m2 (the plots shown in the report use m2)?
ANSWER: I AM NOT SURE WHAT YOU REFER TO? PLEASE FIND THE ORIGINAL DATAFILE I SENT YOU. THERE IT SAYS THAT A.LF IS IN M2 AND NOT IN G

DF response: Correct - original says m2, our mistake sorry.

12. There were two variables called total mass (m.to) in the spreadsheet you sent. The first looks to be correct (i.e. is sum of other variables) so we have used that. What is the second variable (now renamed to m.to2)?
ANSWER: I AM SORRY FOR THE MISTAKE. THE FIRST ONE (MY EXCEL DATA COLUMN N) IS CORRECT, THE SECOND ONE (COLUMN Q) IS WRONG. WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT I INSERTED FOR YOU AN ADDITIONAL COLUMN WITH TOTAL ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS IN THE EXCEL SHEET. THE SECOND COLUMN Q WAS THE ONE THAT I USED BEFORE FOR TOTAL BIOMASS. IT SUMMED UP THE BIOMASS VALUES IN CONTIGUOUS COLUMNS. BECAUSE I INSERTED A COLUMN WITH ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS, THAT VALUE WAS ERRONEOUSLY ADDED AGAIN TO THE TOTAL BIOMASS. SO JUST DELETE THE SECOND COLUMN.
