"Sampling strategy","Published and unpublished data sets for multiple species and sites across Australia were utilized to determine allometric relationships for tropical and subtropical euclaypt woodlands.  A total of 220 individual trees of various sizes (basal area range: ~4 to 10 m2) were sampled to determine dry weight of leaves, branches and stems and allometric relationships. Trees grew under a range of enviroments from the wet-dry tropical region of the Northern Territory to the major savanna and woodland types of central and eastern Queensland, and New South Wales. "
"Height","Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground to the highest apex."
"Biomass","Aboveground biomass was estimated by direct harvest techniques. Trees were felled and separated into the component parts of trunk, branches and leaves.  Fresh weight of all material was weighed and subsamples were dried at 65-80oC until constant mass for determination of the dry-mass correction factor."
"Growth environment","Six sites in the wet-dry tropical region, with additional sites in the savanna and woodland plant community types of Australia.  "
"Other variables","Mean annual rainfall provided where available."
