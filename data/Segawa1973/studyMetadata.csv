Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sample trees were hybrid poplar of three strains (first three trees are Kamabuchi, second three are I-154, and last three are I-214) planted in Terada Experimental Site, Iwate, Japan (340 m a.s.l.) 14 years befores. Sample trees were selected to represent size classes. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers and separated into stem, branches, and leaves."
Leaf area,"Total leaf area was estimated from fresh mass and the ratio of leaf area to fresh mass. Thirty leaves were  selected randomly from the upper, middle and lower crown and their leaf areas were measured by the automatic planimeter."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Method not reported."
Biomass,"Measured fresh mass of each component was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken from each layer. Stem discs were collected from each layer as subsamples. Subsamples were oven-dried at 82 deg C."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Segawa et al. (1969). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara"
