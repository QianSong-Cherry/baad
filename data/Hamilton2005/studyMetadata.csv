Sampling strategy,"A total of 18 trees were sampled for estimation of overstory biomass, and to aid the development of allometric relationships for Eucalyptus microcarpa, across the range of tree sizes found within the area of the Dookie Forest Reserve. Larger trees were oppportunisticly sampled (for example, after storm damage) through the period July 1996 to June 1998, and smaller trees were deliberately felled in July 1996.  Sampling strategy entailed treating ",,,
Leaf area,,,,
Stem cross sectional area,"Stem diameter was measured at 30 cm aboveground, along with the length and diameter of the main stem at its apex.  ",,,
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground surface to the highest apex of each tree (or stem).,,,
Crown area,"Crown width was measured at right angles, including the widest width.  ",,,
Biomass,"Harvested material from a given stem was separated into leaves, twigs and branches. Branchwood and branchbark were further separated into individual components. The fresh weight of all material above 20 kg was determined using a weighbridge, while all material under 20 kg was measured on a desktop scale.  Sub-samples of all fresh material were taken randomly, then dried to current weight at 80 degrees C, and the dry weight to fresh weight ratio determined.  ",,,
traits,"Wood density was obtained using increment corer samples, and by the water displacement method.  Regression equations (for aboveground biomass) were developed by relating the dry weight of individual tree components and total tree aboveground weight to diameter measurements (see Reference article for more details on both).
