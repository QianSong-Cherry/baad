9. Please review the plots showing how your data compares to other data in the study. Does your data fall well within the rest of the dataset?  Are there outliers?
	 If so, could you please review the original data file you provided us with and verify that all information is correct.
ANSWER: Most of the data falls within the rest of the dataset; tends to be high relative to the rest of this data, esp. in bark biomass, and total biomass relative to dbh and crown width. However, I am comfortable with how this data was collected and the results calculated. Grey Box does tend to be a tree with a heavy canopy and trunk relative to its height as a dominant woodland species.
