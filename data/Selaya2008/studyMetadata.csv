"Sampling strategy","A plot of 0.7 ha was established in a 0.5 y/o secondary forest at a minimal distance of 20 m from the edge of this forest stand (beyond this there was primary forest). Ten to 20 individuals (all had grown from seed) per species were selected such that bracketed the height range at which each occurred in the plot."
"Leaf area", "Digital photographs of representative leaves were taken and scanned for leaf area using the software Sigma Scan Pro 5. The leaves were then dried at 70oC for 5 days to obtain SLA."
"Stem cross sectional area","Calculated from diameter measurements at .3 and 1.3 m height"
"Height","Destructively : trees were cut at the base allowing direct height measurements"
"Crown area","Crown diameter was measured visually in two directions"
"Biomass","Individuals were harvested and clipped into 25 cm segments. Stems branches and leaves were put into separate bags and ovendried for 5 days at 70oC."
"Traits","Wood density: green volume by water displacement and then dry weight; Leaf angle using protractor; Leaf N content with Kjehldahl method; Tree LAI measured with a LI2000."
"Growth environment","Light measurements using quantum sensors and relative light distribution in the canopy calculated from the leaf area distribution measured using the point method (i.e. raising a telescopic pole and counting leaf contacts)"
