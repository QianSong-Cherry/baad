  	abstract = {A 22-year-old spacing study was used to examine development of leaf area index (LAI) from different initial spacings in giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.) Buchholz). Fifteen trees ages 3â€“36 years were dissected to develop leaf area predictions from sapwood cross-sectional area. Tree leaf area and LAI were estimated from three plots per spacing for nine spacing treatments ranging from 2.1 to 6.1 m. Crown width and crown length measurements at 10, 16, and 22 years were used to assess crown architecture. Tree leaf area was greatest at low densities. LAI increased with age through age 22 but did not display patterns of convergence to a common LAI level. Higher stand densities reached a maximum LAI of about 7.0. Low stand densities reached LAIs of 2 to 3 and showed no trends toward the maximum through age 22. Crown architecture apparently limits leaf area development. Sequoia has a narrow crown form with crown length to crown width ratios over 3.0 at age 22. At young ages, a crown architecture limitation prevents attainment of maximum LAI at lower densities. Trends in crown shape and leaf area density indicate lower densities will not reach maximum LAI for many decades if at all.},
