Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Whole hectare of trees measured to develop frequency of diameters, then divided into six classes and random tree from each class selected and felled.  All branches measured along stem and diameter taken.  Crown divided into thirds and 5 branches in each crown zone sampled.  "
Leaf area,For each branch in each crown zone a sub-sample of 10 leaves taken and leaf area measured.  Leaves dried at 70C to constant weitght
Stem cross sectional area,Stem diameter measure with diameter tape at 1.3m
Height,Height was measured on felled trees from ground to vertex with a tape
Crown area,"Not measured, although branch lengths and position on crown were but not branch angle"
Biomass,The general harvest protoco was as follows: see references in appended.  Essentially trees felled and stratified random selection of branches collected and mass of leaves in each sampled class assessed
traits,SLA was determined as described above for 'Leaf area'
Growth environment,"Young, managed eucalyptus nitens plantations well managed and planted at 1430 stems per hectare.  Fertiliser history given in papers.  "
