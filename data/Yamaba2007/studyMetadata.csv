"Sampling strategy","Quercus serrata were sampled in two Q. serrata dominated secondary natural forests in 2005: Miyoshi city-1 (215 m a.l.s; NE facing slope; slope = 13 degrees) and Shobara city-2 (580 m; NE; 28 degrees) (Yamaba 2007). Both sites used to be dominated by Pinus densiflora before many pine trees were killed by pine wilt disease. P. densiflora were sampled in P. densiflora dominated secondary natural forest at Higashihiroshima city-3 (415 m; SE; 5 degrees) in August 2006. Chamaecyparis obtusa was sampled in two plantations in 2004: Miyoshi city-Toukaichimachi (207m; E; 12 degrees) and Shobara city-Nigorikawachyo (484 m; SW; 33 degrees). Within each site, 20 times 20 m quadrate was created and stem diameter at breast height and tree height of all trees within the quadrate were measured. One dominant tree, two average-sized trees, and one suppressed tree were chosen from each quadrate and were cut down. Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0.2-1.2 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward for evergreen gymnosperm and in horizontal layers of 0.2-3.2 m, and at intervals of 3 m upward for Q. serrata and divided into stem, branches, leaves, and dead branches and leaves. Green parts of C. obtusa were categorized as leaves. Leaves of P. densiflora were easily divided from branches because sampling was conducted in August when the leaves are elongated. Coarse roots were excavated by a winch and the remained roots were dug up manually. After soil was washed away, roots were divided by the root diameter class. Because the Q. serrata tree with diameter at breast height (d.bh) = 0.341 m was multi-stemmed, d.bh and tree height (h.t) were calculated as: d.bh = 2*square root (total basal area of all stems/pi); h.t = mean height of all stems."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Tree height was measured by measuring tape after trees were cut down."
"Biomass","Each component in each layer or each diameter class was weighted (Yamaba 2007). Fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the dry/fresh mass ratio. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken for each component and each layer for aboveground and for each diameter class for roots. Subsamples were oven-dried at 105 degree C until there was no change in the mass. Dry mass of dead branches and leaves were not included in this data paper (see Yamaba 2007 for the dry mass for these components). For fine roots (diameter > 5 mm) that were unavailable to dug up, dry mass was estimated from the root diameter at the distal end where the roots were missing using the allometric equation log(dry mass) = a*log(D^2)+b where D is root diameter at the distal end and a and b are parameters. This equation was obtained from samples collected in the same stands as the felled trees."
"Other variables","Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
