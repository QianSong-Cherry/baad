"Sampling strategy","One-hundred and nintey-one trees were felled, and their total height, clear bole length, crown diameter, stem diameter at 1/10 of Height, stem diameter just below the lowest living branch, stem diameters at 0.0 and 1.3 m aboveground and stem diameters at 5.0 m intervals were measured.  Biomass from felled trees was estimated using the stratified clip technique.  The tree body in each stratum (0.0-1.3 m, 1.3-5 m, 5-10 m, and then at intervals of 5m) was separated into stem, branches and leaves and each organ was weighed with balances appropriate to the size of the organ.  Subsamples of stems, branches and leaves were taken from each stratum of sample trees for estimating the ratio of fresh/dry mass, specific gravity of stem and leaf area.  Leaf samples were either traced by hand or photocopied."
"Leaf area","Leaf area for each stratum was calculated by multipling total leaf weight by the corresponding specific leaf area of subsampled leaves (traced by hand or photocopied and calculated using a planimeter or counting squares), and then the leaf area values of all of the strata were added to obtain leaf area per tree.  "
"Stem cross sectional area","Stem diameter was measured at multiple points along the tree (0.0, 1/10 the height of the tree, 130 cm aboveground, just below the lowest living branch, and at 5.0 m intervals along the full height of the tree).  "
"Height","Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground surface to the highest apex of each tree."
"Biomass","Trees were separated into stems, branches and leaves according to different height strata (0-1.3m, 1.3-5m, 5-10m  and then at intervals of 5 m), and then weighed fresh in the field. Sub-samples from each strata were dried at 80oC for at least 7 days to obtain fresh mass/dry mass ratios."
"Growth environment","Field, wild."
"Year collected","1980-1981"
