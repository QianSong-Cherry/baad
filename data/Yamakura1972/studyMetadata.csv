Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted in a 30 year-old Chamaecyparis obtusa plantation located on a slope of Mt. Watamuki, Shiaga, Japan (Yamakura et al. 1972). A sample plot (20 m times 15 m) was created in April of 1968. Six sample trees covering the size range were felled in November 1968. Stem diameter at 0.0 and 1.3 m aboveground, stem diameter just below the lowest living branch, stem diameter at 1/10 of tree height, tree heigh, clear bole length, and crown radius in two direction were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth and separated into stem, branches, and foliage. Roots were cut into stump root and lateral roots and each was excavated by stump pulling apparatus. Most of the roots < 2 mm in diameter were torn off at pulling. To estimate root mass of these roots, ten trenches, 0.5 times 0.5 times 1.0 m, were dug out. "
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Tree height and height to the lowest living branch were measured."
Biomass,"Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken for each component (stem, branch, foliage, and root) and each layer. These samples were mixed for each tree and each component. Fresh mass for stem ranged 772-1618 g. Subsamples were oven-dried at 80 deg C."
