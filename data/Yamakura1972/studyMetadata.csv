Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted in a 30 year-old Chamaecyparis obtusa plantation located on a slope of Mt. Watamuki, Shiaga, Japan (Yamakura et al. 1972). A sample plot (20 m times 15 m) was created in April of 1968. Stem diameter at breast height and tree height were measured in May and November. Six sample trees covering size range were felled in November 1968. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth and separated into stem, branches, and foliage. Roots were excavated by stump pulling apparatus. The roots < 2 mm in diameter were torn off at pulling. To estimate root mass of these roots, ten trenches, 0.5 times 0.5 times 1.0 m, were dug out."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Biomass,"Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken and oven-dried at 80 deg C."
Other variables,"Species name and family names according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
