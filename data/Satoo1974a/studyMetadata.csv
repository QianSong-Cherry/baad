"Sampling strategy","Sampling was conducted in three 23-42 year-old Thujopsis dolabrata plantations (I, II, III) located in Kooti, Anamizu-machi, the Noto Peninsula, Japan. Details of each stand is listed in Table 1 of Satoo et al. (1974a). Five sample trees were selected in each stand to cover a wide range of diameter and were cut down at ground level in the summer of 1963. Sample trees were treated with stratified sampling technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, at intervals of 2 m upward. Stem, branches, new needles, and old needles were separated for each layer."
"Leaf area","Total projected needle area was estimated from needle fresh mass and the ratio of needle area to fresh mass. Subsample of needles were collected from each layer. Projected needle area was measured with a photoelectric planimeter."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Stem mass was estimated from volume and bulk density. Stem discs collected from the base of each stem segments were used for stem analysis to obtain stem volume, and then weighted and oven-dried to obtain bulk density. Branch and needle mass was obtained from converting to fresh mass by the ratio of dry to fresh mass. Subsample of branches or needles was taken for each layer and weighted to obtain the ratio of dry to fresh mass."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Satoo et al. (1974a). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
