"Sampling strategy","Six sample trees each were selected near two plots (1-A-II: low density of 1421 trees/ha, 1-B-II: high density of 2870 trees/ha) to represent each diameter class in September 1967 (Kato and Segawa 1973). Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth. Fresh weights of stem, branches, and leaves were measured. Roots of four trees were excavated, separated into main, large (diameter >= 7 mm), medium (2-7 mm), fine (< 2 mm) roots, and weighted."
"Leaf area","Leaf area was estimated from subsamples (Kato and Segawa 1973)."
"Height","Method not reported in Kato and Segawa (1973)."
"Biomass","Subsamples of each organ were taken from each layer and oven-dried at 80 degrees C for more tahn 48 hours (Kato and Segawa 1973). The dry-to-fresh weight ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry weight of each tree component."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Kato and Segawa (1973). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
