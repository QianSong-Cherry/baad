"Sampling strategy"," Sample trees were felled in August 1976 near the 1-ha permanent plot in a natural Cryptomeria japonica forest (760 m a.s.l.) located in the compartment 6, sub-compartment 1 of the Sado Experimental Forest of Niigata University, Japan. Trees were selected to cover various size classes. Tree age was estimated from the number of annual rings at the height of tree cut. Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth. Tree segment in each layer was divided into stem, branches, and needles. Green branches are all categorized as needles."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken at the base of stem segment, or subsample of ca. 2 kg for branches and needles. Subsamples were weighted for their fresh mass, oven-dried at 80 deg C for 24-72 h, and weighted for dry mass."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Saito (1981). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
