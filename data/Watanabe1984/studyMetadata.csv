Sampling strategy,"Sample trees were felled in a Quercus myrsinaefolia plantation located in the compartment II-11 of the Tanashi Experimental Field, University of Tokyo (60 m a.s.l.) in December of 1978. Three-year old seedlings were planted in July 1972. Density was 7043 trees/ha in 1978. Twelve trees were selected to represent each size class. Sample trees were cut down at ground level and then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0.5 m depth and divided into stem, branches, and leaves."
Leaf area,"Leaf area of each layer was also estimated for each tree from dry mass and the ratio of leaf area to mass. The ratio was obtained for each layer. Leaf area of subsample was measured with an automatic planimeter (Hayashi-Denko AAM-7)."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Method not reported."
Biomass,"Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsample taken from each tree and each layer. Subsamples were oven-dried at 85 degC for more than 18 h."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Watanabe and Yagi (1984). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
