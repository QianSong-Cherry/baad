Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Harvest was conducted in a 3 0.01-ha subplots (10 m times 10 m) in a broadleaf forest plot (20 m  times 95 m) at Sanbe Forest of Shimane University in August 1983 (Katagiri et al. 1984). All trees with diameter >= 4.8 cm were felled. Additionally, three trees with diameter >= 25 cm were felled from other plots. Trees felled in 1976 and 1982 were also reported. After felling, stem diameters at breast height, tree height, and height of the lowest living branch were measured."
Height,"Method was not reported in Katagiri et al. (1984)."
Biomass,"Fresh weights of stem, branches, and leaves were measured. Detailed method was not reported in Katagiri et al. (1984)."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Katagiri et al. (1984). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
