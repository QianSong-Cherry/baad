Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Eucalyptus sideroxylon seedlings were grown under a treatment combination of ambient or elevated temperature (26/18C or 30/22C) and subambient, ambient or elevated CO2 (280, 400 or 640 ?L L-1).  Seedlings were grown at full field capacity for 9 months, after which a drought treatment was applied to one half of the seedlings for approximately 3 months. Seedlings were grown from 265-290 days from planting, at which time they were subjected to a destructive harvest of all biomass.  "
Leaf area,"All leaves were measured in a leaf area meter (LI-COR 3100, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebr.).  "
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from the pot surface to the highest apex.
Biomass,"Stems, leaves and roots were destructively harvested on multiple days (78, 79, 80, 83 and 85 days) after planting, and dried for 1 week at 70degreesC."
