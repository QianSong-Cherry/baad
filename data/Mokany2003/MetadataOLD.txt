/underline{Species}: ???
Eucalyptus delegatensis R. T. Baker, family: Myrtaceae

Size range
2-42 meters in height. 4 to 54 years old.

Number of individuals
24

/underline{Leaf area}: ???
Total leaf area was estimated from total leaf mass and leaf mass per area.

Area of sapwood, heartwood cross section and/or total stem cross section
Two 4 cm thick discs were cut from each tree, one at the base (about 40 cm above ground) and one at the base of live crown. The area of heartwood and sapwood was measured using Model 3100 area meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) on tracings from the disks.
 
/underline{Height}: ??? and height of crown
Height of total plant and height to the base of the live crown was measured.

/underline{Biomass}: ???Total leaf mass
10 random primary branches of varying diameter were sampled. All foliage of these branches were collected and weighed. This was then scaled to total leaf mass.

Leaf mass per area
Was separatly determined for adult, juvenile and intermediate morphologies from 100 leaves per group using a Model 3100 area meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE).

Plant functional type
Evergreen angiosperm

/underline{Growth environment}: ???
Field, wild.

Position in forest canopy
Suppressed and dominant trees

Location where sampled
Bago and Maragle State Forests, NSW, Australia.

Latitude and longitude of location
35°42' S, 148°30' E

Vegetation type
Temperate forest

Mean annual rainfall
1400 mm
