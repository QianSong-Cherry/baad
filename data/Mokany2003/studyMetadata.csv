"Sampling strategy","We destructively sampled 13 suppressed trees (growing under a canopy of taller dominant trees) with heights ranging from 2.3 to 35.1 m, plus eleven dominant trees (forming the canopy of a stand with direct access to sunlight) with heights ranging from 2.6 to 41.3 m. Each sample tree was felled and a range of measurements undertaken."
"Leaf area","The basal diameters of all primary branches on each tree were measured, and foliage mass for each tree estimated using an existing allometric relationship between branch diameter and foliage mass. Once the foliage dry mass for each branch on each tree had been estimated by applying the existing allometric relationship, the estimated foliage dry masses were totalled for each tree. Specific leaf area was determined for three groups of leaves; namely, adult, juvenile and intermediate morphologies; in each group, the area of 100 fresh leaves was measured with a Model 3100 area meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE), and leaf dry mass determined. Whole-tree foliage area was then determined by multiplying the total foliage mass for each tree by the relevant specific leaf area value for the leaves on that tree (e.g., the juvenile SLA value for trees composed of juvenile leaves)."
"Stem cross sectional area","Two stem disks (about 4 cm thick) were taken from each tree, one at the base of the stem (BH = basal height about 40 cm above ground level) and the other at the BLC. After sanding each disk with coarse and then fine sandpaper, sapwood was clearly distinguishable from heartwood by its lighter color. The area of sapwood for each stem disk was traced onto tracing paper. The tracing was cut out, sprayed with paint, and its area measured with a Li-Cor Model 3100 area meter."
"Height","Each sample tree was felled and its overall height and the height to the base of the live crown (BLC) measured."
"Biomass","The basal diameters of all primary branches on each tree were measured, and foliage mass for each tree estimated using an existing allometric relationship between branch diameter and foliage mass. Once the foliage dry mass for each branch on each tree had been estimated by applying the existing allometric relationship, the estimated foliage dry masses were totalled for each tree. Leaves were dried at 80degC for 7 days for measurement of dry mass."
"Traits"," Specific leaf area was determined for three groups of leaves:, adult, juvenile and intermediate morphologies. In each group, the area of 100 fresh leaves was measured with a Model 3100 area meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE)."
