"Sampling strategy","Sampling was conducted in 10 plots in May 1956. These plots were in 53-year-old Pinus densiflora plantation located in compartment 93-i of the national forest in Sasakami village, Niigata, Japan. Averaged sized tree was selected and cut down at ground level from each plot. Tree height, height of the lowest living branch, and stem diameters at breast height were measured. Sample trees were then divided into stem, branches, and leaves."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from subsamples."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Yamada et al. (1957). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
