Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Survey was conducted in three plots in a secondary oak forest about 40-years old in August 1984 (Hashizume 1985). Two plots were heavily thinned in 1978 to make them into Quercus acutissima dominant stands and the density was 600 trees/ha in 1984. Fertilizer of 3-5 kg/tree (N: P: K = 13: 17: 12, %; 900-1500 kg/ha) was applied to one of two plots for three years after thinning. Third plot was untreated control with density of 800-1000 trees/ha in 1984. After 6 years, in 1984, 15 sample trees, 5 from each plot, were selected to represent averaged size. Method of biomass measurement was the same as Hashizume and Kodani (1985, Studies on the improvement of the secondary forest of broad-leaved trees (I) The effect of improved cutting on the growth of the secondary forest of Buna (Fagus crenata Blume). Bull. Fac.Agric. Tottori Univ. 38: 51-59). Sample trees were felled after the measurement of diameter at breast height, tree height, and height of the lowest living branch. "
Height,"Measured before sample trees were felled (Hashizume and Kodani 1985)."
Biomass,"Fresh mass of stem, branches, leaves, and fruits were measured. Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass (Hashizume and Kodani 1985). The ratio was estimated from subsamples which were oven-dried at 100 degrees C."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Hashizume (1985). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
