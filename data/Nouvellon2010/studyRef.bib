  abstract = {Specific leaf area ({SLA;} m2leaf\&\#xa0;kg−1leaf) is a key ecophysiological parameter influencing leaf physiology, photosynthesis, and whole plant carbon gain. Both individual tree-based models and other forest process-based models are generally highly sensitive to this parameter, but information on its temporal or within-stand variability is still scarce. In a 2–4-year-old Eucalyptus plantation in Congo, prone to seasonal drought, the within-stand and seasonal variability in {SLA} were investigated by means of destructive sampling carried out at 2-month intervals, over a 2-year period. Within-crown vertical gradients of {SLA} were small. Highly significant relationships were found between tree-average {SLA} ({SLAt)} and tree size (tree height, Ht, or diameter at breast height, {DBH):} {SLAt} ranged from about 9\&\#xa0;m2\&\#xa0;kg−1 for dominant trees to about 14–15\&\#xa0;m2\&\#xa0;kg−1 for the smallest trees. The decrease in {SLAt} with increasing tree size was accurately predicted from {DBH} using power functions. Stand-average {SLA} varied by about 20\% during the year, with lowest values at the end of the 5-month dry season, and highest values about 2–3 months after the onset of the wet season. Variability in leaf water status according to tree size and season is discussed as a possible determinant of both the within-stand and seasonal variations in {SLA.}},
