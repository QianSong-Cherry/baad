"Sampling strategy","Ten to fifteen trees were sampled at each date. Before each sampling campaign height and DBH were measured on six permanent plots. The diameter distribution was divided into 10–15 classes, and one tree per class was randomly selected outside the permanent plots."
"Leaf area","All leaves of each of three crown sections (lower, middle and upper) were removed, and weighed. Twenty-five leaves were randomly  selected in each section, and their fresh mass and area were immediately measured. These leaves were then dried at 65.8C to constant weight, and their dry weights were used in conjunction with their measured area to calculate specific leaf area for each crown section. The foliage dry weight of each crown section was calculated from the foliage fresh weight and the dry to fresh weight ratio of the sub- samples. The leaf area of each crown section was calculated as the product of foliage dry weight and specific leaf area. Tree leaf area was obtained by summing the leaf area of the three crown sections."
"Stem cross sectional area","Stem cross sectional area of each tree was calculated from DBH measurement"
"Height","Sampled trees were felled and measured for total height"
"Crown area","Not measured"
"Biomass","The following compartments were considered: stem wood, stem bark, leaves, dead branches and living branches. The stem was cut into 1 m sections. Fresh mass of each compartment was measured on the field. Component biomass was sub-sampled to evaluate the dry matter content: one 5 cm thick cross section for each log, about 25% of each branch compartment and 25 leaves by level within the crown (bottom, middle, top). Aliquots were weighed before and after drying at 65.8C to constant weight. The dry weight of each component was calculated from measured fresh weight and the dry to fresh weight ratio of the sub-samples."
"traits","For each crown section (lower, middle and upper), twenty-five leaves were randomly selected, and their area and dry weight were measured. The tree averaged area and weight of individual leaves was estimated from the mean leaf area and weight of leaves in each crown section , weighted by the contribution of each crown section in the total tree leaf biomass."
"Growth environment","Meteorological variables (rainfall, air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed and direction, net and global radiation) were measured (about 5 m above the canopy) from the top of a tower located within this Eucalyptus stand"
"Other variables","The deep sandy soils are classified as Ferralic Arenosols according to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) classification, with high sand (80–90%) and low clay (8–10%) and silt (2–2.5%) contents. Other information about the soils and the management of these eucalypt plantations can be found in Nouvellon et al., 2010."
