Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted in a Cinnamomum camphora plantation (200 m a.s.l.) located in the section b, compartment 17 of the University of Tokyo Chiba Forest. Trees were planted in 1910 and the sampling was conducted in July 1956, thus ca. 46 years old. At the time of sampling, leaves were fully developed. Sample trees were selected according to the URLICH-II method. After cutting trees, tree height and the height of branches were measured. Each sample tree was divided into leaves, branches, and stem. Branches were further divided into current year branches, the older branches below 1 cm in diameter, those from 1 to 5 cm, and those above 5 cm."
Leaf area,"Leaves were mixed and subsamples of 20-30 g were taken for each tree. Leaf area of the subsample leaves were measured by the dot-counting method (Negishi et al. 1957 J. Jp. For. Soc. 39: 380-384) before the subsample was oven-dried. Then total leaf area of a tree was estimated from total dry mass and the ratio of leaf area to dry mass of subsampled leaves."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured after trees were cut down."
Biomass,"Measured fresh mass of leaves or braches was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. Leaves were weighted for fresh mass, mixed, and subsamples of 20-30 g were taken. Leaf area and fresh mass of these subsample leaves were measured before oven-drying at 85 deg C for 48 h and weighting for dry mass.  Subsample of current year branches were collected similarly and oven-drying at 85 deg C for 72 h. For the older branches below 1 cm in diameter, subsamples of 25-85 g were taken.  For the older branches 1-5 cm, 2-10 discs were taken. For the older branches above 5 cm, discs were taken from all branches at an interval of 1 m. Stem dry mass was estimated from stem volume using the bulk density determined for stem discs taken at the height of 0, 0.3, 1.3m, at the interval of 2 m upward to the base of crown, and at the interval of 1 m upward. Average bulk density of 0.585 was used. Stem volume was determined by the stem analysis."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Satoo (1968). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
