Topic,"Description"
Sampling strategy,"Seeds were of local provenance obtained from the National Tree Seed Centre (Canadian Forest Service Atlantic Forestry Centre, Fredericton, NB) and grown in glasshouse at the Faculty of Forestry, University of Toronto (CA), under high and low nutrient and light treatments. Individuals sampled from 1 to 5 months of age. Biomass harvests were conducted on 5–6 June, 21–23 July and 3–5 September 2003. Betula papyrifera and Populus grandidentata showed low germination rates and therefore seedlings were not available for the first harvest. Additionally, both species had 100% mortality in low light and thus data are missing for low-light measurements. For the first two harvests, five seedlings per species and treatment were selected at random. The final harvest included all surviving seedlings."
Leaf area,"Fresh leaves from each harvest were measured for area individual and total area."
Stem cross sectional area,"Stem diameter measured at base."
Height,"Total height measured along the stem, from base to apical bud."
Biomass,"Seedlings were divided into roots, stems and leaves which were then oven dried for 5 days at 60oC to constant weight and weighted."
traits,"age (months), total height (cm), stem diameter at base (mm), leaf area (cm^2), total leaf mass (g), total root mass (g), stem mass (g), Single leaf area (cm^2), leaf mass per area (g/cm^2)."
Growth environment,"GH"
Other variables,"In the final harvest fresh leaf area of leaves measured for gas-exchange was determined for calculation of leaf mass per area; Photon flux density (PFD) was measured using Hobo Weather Stations (Onset Computer, Bourne, Mass.)."
