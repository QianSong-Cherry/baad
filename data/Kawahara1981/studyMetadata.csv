"Sampling strategy","In February 1980, seven or five trees from each of nine plots were felled (A2 and A4: Albizia falcata plantation,  G3: Gmelina arborea plantation, S: Swietenia macrophylla plantation, D: natural Dipterocarp forest). In A4, six sample trees other than Albizia falcata were felled as well. After recording diameters at 0.3 m and 1.3m above the ground, total heights ,and the height of the lowest living branch of each sample tree, the fresh weights of the stems, branches, and leaves were determined separately by the stratified-clip technique on one meter of stratum located away from the top and base."
"Height","Measured by measuring tape."
"Biomass","Small samples of the respective tree components in each stand also were brought to the University of the Philippines at Los Banos for determination of oven-dry weight and leaf area. (Kawahara et al. 1981). Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Kawahara et al. (1981). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
