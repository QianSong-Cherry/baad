Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Completed above and belowround harvests were conducted during the winter of 2008 and the winter of 2009.  We harvested 9 Pinus taeda genotypes in total; 3 clones, 3 full-sib families, and 3 half-sib families. 2 clones were planted as containerized and bare-root seedlings, such that there were actually 11 'individuals'.  In winter 2008 (age 2), we harvested four trees of each genotype and the study location (Onslow County, NC, USA, managed pine plantation).  We conducted the same harvesting protocol on 2 trees per genotype in winter 2009 (age 3).  With one missing tree, we have data on 65 trees.  "
Leaf area,"For each tree, a randomly sampled subset of needles was collected from throught the canopy.  These needles were scanned (Epson scanner) and the images were analyzed using ImageJ software to estimate total fresh area of the subsample.  The needles were then oven dried (70 C), and one-side SLA (cm2 g-1) for each tree was determined.  This SLA values was then multiplied by total needle dry mass to estimate total canopy one-sided leaf area (m2)"
Stem cross sectional area,Stem diameter was measured at the groundline using digital calipers.  Measures were taken in two directions.  Diameter at breast-height was also measured on age 3 trees.
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground to the highest apex.
Crown area,Not measured.
Biomass,"The general harvest protoco was as follows: Ground-line diameter and height were measured and each tree was felled onto a tarp. The aboveground portion was then separated into foliage, branches, and stem. Briefly, total fresh mass of each component was measured in the field and a subsample representing *25 % of the component fresh mass was weighed and dried to a constant mass at 70  C. Total dry mass (kg) of each component was calculated as the product of total fresh weight and subsample moisture content (%). Following the aboveground harvest, a 0.5 m3 volume of soil, centered on the cut stem, was carefully excavated so that taproot, coarse root, and fine root biomass could be estimated.  Samples were sieved, washed and dried at 70 C to estimate dry mass. "
traits,SLA was determined as described above for 'Leaf area'
Growth environment,"Young, managed pine plantation.  Tree were planted in rows in single-tree plot design.  Some competing woody and herbaceous vegetation but trees were dominant in the canopy."
Other variables,"latitude, longitude, mean annual precipitation, and mean annual temperature are provided.  We also measured tap root dry mass separately, but this data can be added to get total coarse root dry mass if necessary."
