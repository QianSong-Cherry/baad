Sampling strategy,"In the November 2000 and September 2001, 16 trees were harvested in a forest adjacent to the Yamashiro Experimental Forest (Dannoura et al. 2003). Each tree was cut down and roots were excavated carefully (Dannoura et al. 2006)."
Height,"Tree height was measured after trees were cut down except Ilex pedunculosa tree with DBH = 47.49 cm, which was estimated from a allometric equation (Dannoura et al. 2006)."
Biomass,"Aboveground and root dry weights were measured after oven-dried at 95 degrees C for 48 hours(Dannoura et al. 2006)."
Other variables,"Root biomass data for trees reported in Goto et al. (2003) are merged with the data of Goto2013 by M. Ishihara. Only data for trees not reported in Goto et al. (2003) are listed here. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
