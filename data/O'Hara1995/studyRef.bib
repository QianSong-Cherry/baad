  abstract = {Ponderosa pine (Pinusponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) frequently grows in pure, multi-aged stands throughout its range. Sapwood-leaf area prediction equations were developed for multi-aged, multi-strata ponderosa pine stands in western Montana and central Oregon. No significant differences were found between equations for trees from lower or upper strata, or between equations for all trees and equations for upper or lower strata trees in either study location. These results indicate overstory ponderosa pine trees do not require significantly greater sapwood conducting tissue per unit of leaf area than understory trees. Single variable models using only sapwood area at breast height are recommended.},
