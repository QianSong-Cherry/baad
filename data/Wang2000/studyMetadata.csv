Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,"Sample trees are collected from Betula papyrifera and Abies lasiocarpa mixedwood forest natural stands. All Betula papyrifera sample trees were dominant trees, and Abies lasiocarpa sample trees are codominate and suppressed trees."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was not measured. However, we can calculate the leaf area by using specific leaf area of Populus tremuloides to convert the leaf biomass data into leaf area data."
Stem cross sectional area,"We can calculate stem cross sectional area by using the diameter at breast height."
Height,"Because all sample trees were at different ages, they have different height."
