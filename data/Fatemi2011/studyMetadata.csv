Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"We sampled six of the major northern hardwood species in the White Mountain National Forest region to determine allometric relationships for small trees. Trees ranged in size from .020-.12 m in diameter at breast height. We sampled 11-12 individuals of each species in the summer of 2004 and 2005. Trees were destructively sampled in the field, and were felled by handsaw or chainsaw. We cut as close to the ground as possible, leaving a stump < 16 cm in height. Trees were typically in co-dominant or dominant positions in the canopy because stands were young ( > 30 years since cutting)."
Growth environment,"Wild, forest stands, under minimal management by the United States Forest Service when study was conducted in 2004 and 2005."
Other variables,Mean annual rainfall provided; Mean annual temperature provided.
Stand age ,Stands ranged from 14-30 years since last cutting (clear-cut) at the time they were sampled.
Vegetation,Temperate forest: northern hardwood
Grouping,"Refers to stands located within the Bartlett Experimental Forest, under jurisdiction of the United States Forest Service.  Stands are part of a larger study entitled 'Multiple Element Limitation in Northern Hardwood Ecosystems' (MELNHE). For more information visit http://www.esf.edu/melnhe/"
Diameter,"The diameter of each tree was measured at 1.37 m (diameter at breast height, d.bh), and at the lowest portion of the stem above the ground that could be measured accurately (d.ba)."
Leaf area,"Approximately 30g of wet fresh leaves were sub-sampled from each individual tree canopy.  Once the tree was felled, we divided the canopy into 3-4 approximately equal length sections.  Sub-samples of leaf material were taken from each section proportionately by contribution of leaf mass in each section to total leaf mass for the tree.  Leaf area was determined by a LiCor LI-3100 meter."
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from bottom of the felled stem to the highest apex on the tree.
Stem bark biomass,"We weighed the stem with bark in the field. Disks were cut from the stem so that the stem was separated into several portions that were small enough in length (< 2 m) to be weighed in the field,.  Stem bark bark was removed from the disks in the laboratory and weighed before and after oven-drying."
Leaf mass,"Foliage, including petioles was weighed in the field; samples were homogenized and sub-sampled for determination of dry weight. Foliage mass also includes the weight of twigs for Betula alleghaneiensis, Betula papyrifera, and Prunus pensylvanica; for other species leaf mass excludes the twigs, and twig weight was considered to be part of the branch weight."
Branch mass,"Note: this value includes bark on branches. Branches were weighed in the field. Branches were divided into three size classes based on average branch basal diameter: small (<1 cm), medium (1-2 cm), and large (>2 cm). Subsamples of branch material were taken from these size classes proportionately by contribution to total branch mass for a totalsubsample mass of 200 g to determine moisture content. Branch weights include the mass of twigs for the following species: Acer saccharum, Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia- for all other species, twigs were included in the weight of foliage."
Aboveground biomass,"The sum of biomass of four individual tree components: stem wood, stem bark, branch, foliage. All four components were weighed in the field and sub-sampled for determination of moisture content and dry weight."
"Year collected","2004-2005"
