"Sampling strategy","Sample trees were felled in a Quercus crispula mixed forest (Shoukawa village,1000 m a.s.l., ca. 100 years old) in July 1990 and 1991 and in a Betula maximowicziana mixed forest (950 m a.s.l., ca. 60 years old) and in a Fagus japonica forest (1050 m a.s.l., ca. 60 years old) in Gifu University Kuraiyama Forest in July 1992 and 1993 (Komiyama et al. 2002). After felling, tree height, height of the lowest living branch, stem diameters at 0, 0.3, 1.3, 2.3 m and at interval of 1 m upward, stem diameter of the lowest living branch were measured. Fresh weights of stem, branches, and leaves were measured."
"Leaf area","Subsample of leaves were collected from each layer and individual leaf area was measured by a leaf area meter. Total leaf area was estimated as the sum of leaf areas of each layer, which are estimated from the leaf mass of the layer and SLA of subsampled leaves (A. Komiyama, personal communication)."
"Stem cross sectional area","Stem diameter at the lowest branch was measured."
"Height","Measured after trees were felled (Komiyama et al. 2002)."
"Biomass","Subsamples (ca. 400 g) of each organ for each species were oven-dried at 110 degrees C for more than 48 hours. The dry-to-fresh mass ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry mass of each tree component."
"Other variables","Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
