Sampling strategy,"Sample trees were felled in a Quercus crispula mixed forest (1000 m a.s.l., ca. 100 years old) in Shoukawa village in July 1990 and 1991 (Komiyama et al. 2002). Sample trees were felled in a Betula maximowicziana mixed forest (950 m a.s.l., ca. 60 years old) and in a Fagus japonica forest (1050 m a.s.l., ca. 60 years old) in Gifu University Kuraiyama Forest in July 1992 and 1993. After felling, tree height, height of the lowest living branch, and stem diameters at 0, 0.3, 1.3, 2.3 m and at interval of 1 m upward were measured. Fresh weights of stem, branches, and leaves were measured."
Leaf area,"Method not reported in Komiyama et al. (2002)"
Height,"Measured after trees were felled (Komiyama et al. 2002)."
Biomass,"Subsamples (ca. 400 g) of each organ for each species were oven-dried at 110 degrees C for more than 48 hours. The dry-to-fresh weight ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry weight of each tree component."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
