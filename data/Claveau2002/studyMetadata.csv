"Sampling strategy","Three study sites in British Columbia and six in Quebec were selected (Table 1). They were selected to ensure that trees of each species could be sampled across a full light gradient (Fig. 1). For each species, care was taken to select stands within the same soil drainage and soil texture classes. Stands with multicanopied structure were preferred, because they offered better opportunities for finding a range of sample tree heights across light gradients. Areas disturbed within the last 10 years (e.g., harvesting, blowdown, insect related attack) were avoided. Study trees were sampled along 5 m wide transects established along gradients of stand density."
"Age","Tree age was estimated from a disk at ground level by counting the number of rings."
"Total height","Stem length from ground level to the tip of the leader."
"Height to crown base","Distance from the ground to the base of the crown."
"Diameter of stem at base","Diameter of the stem above the root swell. This diameter was measured using a caliper."
"Diameter of crown","Average of crown diameters taken on a North-South and East-West axis."
"Crown depth","Distance from the tip of the apex down to the base of the crown."
"Growth environment","Field, wild."
