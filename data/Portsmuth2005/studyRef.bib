	abstract = {Biomass allocation and growth of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris L., of various sizes (height 0.03-20m) and ages (1-151years) were investigated in two infertile sites (raised bog and sand dunes) to determine relative nitrogen and phosphorus limitations on productivity and their interactions and size-dependent controls. Dry mass weighted average nitrogen ({NW)} and phosphorus ({PW)} contents were higher in P. sylvestris in sand dunes than in those in the raised bog, but {PW/NW} ratios overlapped between the sites. Leaf dry mass ratio ({FL)} and leaf-area ratio ({LAR)} increased with {NW}, and {FL} increased with {PW.} The relative growth rate ({RG)} was more strongly associated with {PW} than with {NW.} The net assimilation rate per leaf dry mass ({NARM)} scaled positively with {PW} but not with {NW}, demonstrating that the stronger effect of {PW} on growth was due to modified biomass allocation and physiology ({RG} = {NARM} * {FL)}, while {NW} affected growth via biomass allocation. Partitioning and growth characteristics were poorly related to the {PW/NW} ratio. The overall decrease of growth in larger trees resulted from their lower {LAR} and {FL.} Increases in size further led to a lower {NW} but higher {PW.} We conclude that optimum productivity at a given {NW} requires a certain minimum {PW}, not a specific "non-limiting" {PW/NW} ratio. While nutrients affect growth by changing biomass allocation and physiological activity, size primarily modifies biomass allocation.},
