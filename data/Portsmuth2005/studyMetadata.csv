Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"2005 paper 'Biomass allocation and growth rates in Pinus sylvestris are interactively modified by nitrogen and phosphours availabilities and by tree size and age' in the journal 'Canadian Journal of Forest Research'"
Leaf area,"Total leaf area for each needle age-class was further calculated as the total dry mass of the needles in a specific age class divided by the age-class specific estimate of LMA."
Stem cross sectional area,"trunk diameter from soil level cm measured with caliper"
Height,"trunk height cm from soil level to the trunk top"
Biomass,"ALL DRY MASS at least 48 H at 75degC"
Traits,"projected leaf area from above (cm2) - measured from photograph taken above the tree; projected leaf area from side (cm2) measured from the photograph taken from the side of the tree; projected trunk area from above (cm2)-measured from photograph taken above the tree; projected trunk area from side (cm2) measured from the photograph taken from the side of the tree; projected crown area from above (cm2) measured from photograph taken above the tree leaves and woody parts together; projected crown area from side (cm2) measured from the photograph taken from the side of the tree -leaves and woody parts together; coarse root N% - method described in paper."
Growth environment,"Field, wild"
