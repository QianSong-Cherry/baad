Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,Saplings of Elateriospermum tapos were chosen in the understory of Pasoh forest. Trees of Gamblea innovans and Chengiopanax sciadophylloides were chosen in various light environments in the Kamigamo forest.
Leaf area,"Sample trees were harvested and the number of leaves was counted. Leaf area was measured by a digital scanner in Elateriospermum tapos, and was estimated from total mass of leaves and specific leaf area of leaf discs that were collected randomly."
Stem cross sectional area,"Diameter of the main trunk at 10% of the height was measured for all species, diameter at stem base was measured for Elateriospermum tapos, and diameter at breast height was measured for Gamblea innovans and Chengiopanax sciadophylloides."
Height,Tree height was measured using an extendible pole for all species.
Crown area,The width and depth of each crown were measured for Gamblea innovans and Chengiopanax sciadophylloides. Widths were measured at the widest part of the crown and perpendicular to it. The projected area of the crown was calculated as an ellipse based on these two measurements.
Biomass,Total leaf mass was measured for all species after drying.
Growth environment,"Seventy-eight trees 1.0-2.5 m tall were randomly selected inside the plot, and hemispherical photographs were taken above the apex of these trees with a CoolPix 910 digital camera with an FC-E8 fisheye converter (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). An indirect site factor (ISF) was calculated with Hemiview ver. 2.1 (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). "
