Sampling strategy,"Plots 1-A and 1-B in Maruyama experimental stand were facing the south-east at 180 a.s.l. and planted with Acacia mollissima in 1963 at the density of 2000 trees / ha and 4000 trees / ha, respectively.  Plots 1-A and 1-B in Haseyama experimental stand were facing the north at 200 a.s.l. and planted with Acacia dealbata in 1963 at the density of 2000 trees/ha and 4000 trees/ha, respectively. Details of the plots are listed in Table 1 of Ando and Takeuchi (1973). Eight sample trees covering diameter distribution were harvested from each plot in late November to early December 1967. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m thickness. Fresh weight of stem, branches, leaves, and flowering buds were measured in the field. For three sample trees (large-, middle, small-sized trees) per plot, roots were excavated  in quadrate plots centred on the stump of sampled tress. The area of quadrate plot was 5 square meters for a tree in density of 2000 trees/ha (plots 1-A) and 2.5 square meters for a tree in density of 4000 trees/ha (plots 1-B). All roots within this quadrate plot was assumed to be of the tree."
Leaf area,"Not measured."
Stem cross sectional area,"Not measured."
Height,"Metadata not available."
Crown area,"Not measured."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from subsamples."
Other variables,"Species names follow Ando and Takeuchi (1973)."
