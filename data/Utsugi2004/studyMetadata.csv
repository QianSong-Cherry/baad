"Sampling strategy","10 Quercus crispula, 8 Kalopanax septemlobus, and 8 Betula platyphylla trees located near a permanent plot were cut at ground level. Stem diameter and tree height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m thickness."
"Leaf area","Possible to provide leaf area data with request."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Measured by measuring tape."
"Crown area","Possible to provide crown area data with request."
"Biomass","Fresh weights of leaves, branches and stem were measured separately for each layer and tree. Subsamples of each organ (stem discs, branches, and 10-100 g of fresh leaves) were taken from each layer and oven-dried at 70 degC for 2 days for leaves and for 7 days for branches and stem subsamples. The dry-to-fresh weight ratios of the subsample was used to calculate dry weight of each tree component for each layer."
"Growth environment","91-year-old secondary deciduous broadleaf forest regenerated after forest fire."
"Other variables","Species name and family names according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
