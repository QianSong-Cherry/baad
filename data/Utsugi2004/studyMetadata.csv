Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"10 Quercus crispula, 8 Kalopanax septemlobus, and 8 Betula platyphylla trees located near a permanent plot were cut at ground level. Stem diameter and tree height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m thickness."
Leaf area,"Possible to provide leaf area data with request."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured by measuring tape."
Crown area,"Possible to provide crown area data with request."
Biomass,"Fresh weights of leaves, branches and stem were measured separately for each layer and tree. Subsamples of each organ were taken and oven-dried. The fresh-to-dry weight ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry weight of each tree component."

Growth environment,"91-year-old secondary deciduous broadleaf forest regenerated after forest fire."
