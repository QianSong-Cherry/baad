"Sampling strategy","Trees were sampled from an even-age pure stand. Individuals were selected based on a height and location of the live crown in relation to the canopy of surrounding trees. We defined dominant individuals as trees with a majority of the live crown within or above the canopy of surrounding trees. Suppressed trees had majority of the crown located below the canopy of surrounding trees."
"Stem cross sectional area","Stem cross sectional area was measured at 0.1, 1, DBH and every 1 m to top in two perpendicular directions."
"Height","Total height and diameter at breast height were measured, and stem was cut at 0.1, 1.3 m and every 1 m up to and end diameter of 10 mm after the harvesting."
"Crown area","Crown area was measured using the width and height of the widest point of the crown were measured."
"Biomass","Initial and final diameter of heartwood, sapwood bark and rotten wood were measured at 0.1, 1,3 and every 1 m to calculate wood volume for each component using Smalian formula. Each tree was also separated into: leaves, small branches (<10 mm) with bark, coarse branches with bark (> 10 mm); stem components including sapwood, heartwood and bark. Roots with bark classified as fine (diameter < 2 mm), medium (< 30 mm) or coarse (> 30 mm). Three samples of each component in every tree were taken for biomass calculations (oven dried at 65degC to constant weight) and nutrient analysis. For coarse branches, stem and roots three cross-sectional discs of 30 mm at different lengths were taken and separated into their component pool (heartwood, sapwood, bark and rotten wood) to determinate density for biomass calculations. All small branches, leaves and dead branches from each sampled tree were separated and weighed fresh. Roots from individual trees were excavated to a depth of 0.6 m (maximum rooting depth for all crown classes) in circular plots centred on the stump of selected tress. These roots were sorted in diameter class and weighed in fresh. Sub-samples were taken for oven drying to estimate biomass and for nutrient analysis."
"Growth environment","Soil temperature and air temperature were measured using a datta logger system (HOBBO) that record data every 2 hours. Soil humidity was measured using a Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR EIJKELKAMP, FM 3-14,62, USA)."
