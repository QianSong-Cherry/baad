Topic, "Description"
Sampling strategy, "60 transects were done in 4 sugar maple and yellow birch stands. Seedlings and saplings were selected along the transect to cover the largest size gradient. Individuals were then harvested carefully to obtain total biomass."
Leaf area, "leaf area was calculated using a scanner. For small individuals, total leaf area was scanned while for bigger saplings only half or a third of the leaf area was scanned."
Stem cross sectional area, "Stem Diameter was measured using a digital caliper"
Height, "height was measured using a measuring tape."
Crown area, "Crown width was measured as the mean of 2 perpendicular diameters."
Biomass, "Individuals compartments were partiotioned and then dried until weigth remains constant."
Traits, "Crown height was measured as the lenght of the stem supporting alive branches or leaves. LMA was measured using total leaf area and biomass excepted on bigger individuals for which a subsample was used."
Growth environment, "5-60% of total PPFD. 2/3 of the individuals were growing on deadwood and the rest on mineral soil."
