Sampling strategy,"Sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class or all trees within a plot were felled (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1965). Mt. Tsuruba was surveyed in November 1962. Ise Shrine Forest was surveyed in August 1963. Chiba Forest of Tokyo University was surveyed on 14 November 1962. Suwa was surveyed on 26-31 July 1962. Komagane was surveyed on 11 August 1962. Murakami-Miomote was surveyed on 6-11 August 1962. Sample trees were felled at the base, and diameter at breast height, tree height, height of lowest living branch, and length of longest branch were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward (in some case 2 m intervals). Fresh weight of stem, branches, and leaves in each layer were measured. For conifer species, branches and leaves were separated into layers according to the height of whorl branches which branches and leaves are attached."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was estimated for broadleaf species from fresh weight and leaf area per fresh weight which were obtained from subsample  (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1965)."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured after sample trees were felled (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1965)."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from subsamples (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1965)."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
