"Sampling strategy","Sampling was conducted in a Larix kaempferi plantation (21 years old, 300 m a.s.l.) located at the foothill of Mt. Asibetu in central Hokkaido, Japan. A plot of size 20 m times 30 m were created. Details of the sampling plot are listed in Table 1 of Satoo  (1974c). Ten sample trees were selected to cover a wide range of diameter and cut down at ground level  in the summer of 1961. Sample trees were treated with stratified sampling technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, at intervals of 2 m upward to the crown base, and at intervals of 1 m upward."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh mass of each component (needle, branches and stem) within each layer was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken from each tree for each layer. Stem discs was taken as a subsample at the base of the segment in each layer. Subsamples of branches or needles were collected for each layer."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Satoo (1974c). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
