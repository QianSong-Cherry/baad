Sampling strategy,"This study was carried out in a 35-year-old second-growth forest fragment dominated by Nothofagus dombeyi, in Parque Nacional Puyehue, Chile (40deg39'S, 72deg11'W). Seedlings 25-1180 mm tall of four evergreens differing in shade tolerance were sampled in low light (2-5% canopy openness). Seedling growth was measured from April 2002 till March 2003, when plants were harvested for calculation of growth and biomass distribution parameters."
Leaf area,"The total foliage area of each sapling was measured using An ADC AM100 leaf area meter (ADC BioScientific, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, England)."
Stem cross sectional area,"Basal stem diameter (immediately above any root flanges) was measured on two orthogonal axis, using electronic callipers."
Height,"Height was measured as the length of the longest stem, from the ground to the  apex."
Biomass,"Saplings were divided into root, stem and leaf fractions, and then dried at 70degC for 72 h. Leaf petioles were included in total leaf mass."
Other variables,"The light environment of each seedling (% canopy openness) was estimated using a pair of LAI-2000 canopy analyzers (Li-COR, Lincoln, Nebr); Mean annual rainfall provided."
