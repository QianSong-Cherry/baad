"Sampling strategy","Tree density, mean tree height and mean stem diameter at breast height (1.3 m above the ground) of the plantation were 5826 trees ha -l, 9.8 m and 9.3 cm, respectively. We selected the sample trees for spanning the size class distribution of the plantation."
"Leaf area","Fresh weight of leaves contained in each 1.0 m (for larger trees) or 0.5 m (for smaller trees) thick horizontal layers was measured. Area of leaf samples taken from each layer was determined with an area metre. The foliage weight was finally converted into foliage area using the resulting specific leaf area."
"Stem cross sectional area"," We measured the diameter of stem including bark."
"Height"," We measured the real height after felling the sample trees."
"Crown area"," The area of the vertical projection of the outermost perimeter of the crown on the horizontal plane."
"Biomass","We measured separately the mass of branches, stems, leaves, and roots."
"Traits","Specific leaf area was calculated as a ratio of sample leaf area to sample leaf fresh weight."
"Growth environment","Plantation unmanaged."
