Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted in 12 Abies sachalinensis plantations in Teshio and Tomakomai Experimental Forests, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan. Stand ages and the data of sampling were: stand 1-2: 11 years old, June and August of 1972; stand 3: 11 years, Sep. 1974; stand 4: 18 years, Nov. 1973; stand 5: 38 years, Sep. 1972; stand 6 : 9 years, Oct. 1974; stand 7-9: 12 years, Sep. 1972; stand 10: 35 years, Dec. 1972; stand 11:  ca. 15 years, July 1976; 12: 30-34 years, July 1976. In addition, sampling was conducted in plot 13 in Teshio Experimental Forest, a naturally regenerated ca. 30 year-old A. sachalinensis stand in July 1976. Stand 11-13 were selected to study suppressed trees. Sample trees were selected either to cover size ranges or to represent the average size. Sample trees were cut at ground level. Tree height, height of the lowest living branch, and stem diameters at breast height were measured. Sample trees were then cut into two parts at the height of the lowest living branch. Crown was futhrer cut into whorl strata defined by whorls. For each stratum, needles and branches were detattched from the stem."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured after trees were cut."
Biomass,"Fresh mass of stem and needles + branches were measured for each stratum. Stems were oven-dried at 90 degC and weighted for dry mass. For stand 5 and 10, dry mass was estimated from fresh mass and the ratio of dry to fresh mass which was obtained from a disc collected for each stratum.  Needle fresh mass and branch fresh mass of each whorl stratum were estimated from the needle+branch fresh mass and the ratio of needle to branch mass specific for each stratum. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken from the stratum. Fresh mass was converted to dry mass by the stratum-specific ratio of dry to fresh mass which was obtained from subsamples. Amount of subsample for the conversion ratio was about 10 % of the total fresh mass within the stratum."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Haruki (1979). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
