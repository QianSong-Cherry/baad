Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"urvey was conducted in 13 Abies stands in Teshio Experimental Forest or Tomakomai Experimental Forest, Hokkaido University. For stand 1-6 and 10, sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class. For stand 7-9, a medium sized tree was selected. Length of the longest branch was measured. Sample trees were felled and diameter at breast height, tree height, and height of the lowest living branch were measured. Sample trees in stand 1 and 2 were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-2.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward. Sample trees in other stands were treated stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts according to whorl branch strata. Fresh weights of stem and branches and leaves in each layer were measured. Fresh weight of stem was measured directly or estimated from volume and the ratio of fresh weight to volume of subsamples."
Height,"Measured by measuring tape."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken at each study site."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
