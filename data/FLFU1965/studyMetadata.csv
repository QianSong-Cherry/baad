"Sampling strategy","Sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class or all trees within a plot were felled . Quercus phillyreoides dominated stand at Mt. Tsuruba  was surveyed in November 1962 (estimated as older than 80 years old, south-west facing, slope of 35 degree, Kan et al. 1965 Bull. Kyoto Univ. For. 37:55-75). Camellia japonica dominated stands in Ise Shrine Forest (compartments 28 and 70) and Quercus glauca-Camellia japonica dominated stand (compartment 32) were surveyed in August 1963 (ca. 300-400 m a.s.l., slope of 25 degree). All three stands were coppice forests regenerated after cutting in 1898. Chiba Forest of Tokyo University was surveyed on 14 November 1962. Suwa was surveyed on 26-31 July 1962. Komagane was surveyed on 11 August 1962. Murakami-Miomote was surveyed on 6-11 August 1962. Sample trees were felled at the base, and diameter at breast height, tree height, height of lowest living branch, and length of longest branch were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward (in some case 2 m intervals). For conifer species, branches and leaves were separated into layers according to the height of whorl branches which branches and leaves are attached. Multiple-stemmed trees were excluded for this data paper."
"Leaf area","Leaf area was estimated for broadleaf species from fresh mass and leaf area per fresh mass which were obtained from a subsample (100-200 g in fresh mass) collected from several sampled trees at each stand."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Measured after sample trees were felled."
"Biomass","Fresh mass of components (stem, branches, and leaves) in each layer were measured. Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated for each stand and each component from a subsample (several hundreds to several thousands g) taken from several sampled trees."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases, digitized raw data, and created meta data based on the references (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1965; Kan et al. 1965 Bull. Kyoto Univ. For. 37: 55-75). Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
