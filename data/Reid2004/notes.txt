Reid, D.E.B., Leiffers, V.J. and Silins, U. (2004) Growth and crown efficiency of height repressed logepole pine; are supressed trees more efficient? Trees, 18, 390-398.

Latin name of species
Pinus contorta var. latifolia

Size range
Diameter at breast height (1.3 m) ranging from 1.2 to 20.5 cm.

Number of individuals
139

Individual leaf size and Total leaf area
A sub-sample of fresh needles from each sampled branch was scanned and one-sided, projected leaf area was measured (Sigma Scan-Pro image analysis software). Leaf area of each tree was determined by scaling projected leaf area with specific leaf area and leaf mass.

Area of sapwood, heartwood cross section and/or total stem cross section
Diameter at breast height (1.3 m) was measured for each individual. 1 cm disks were cut at breast height and scanned for sapwood/heartwood cross sectional areas.

Projected crown area and crown surface area
Crown projection area was estimated by measuring crown diameter and assuming circular horizontal crown dimensionsr.

Total height of plant and Height of crown
Heights were measured on each individual.

Biomass; Total leaf mass and Branch mass
Crowns were devided into upper, mid, and lower sections. The fresh weight of all branches and all needles from each crown section were dried to constant weight and weighed.

Leaf mass per area
Needle specific area was determined from the dry weight of the scanned needle sub-sample.

Plant functional type
Evergreen gymnosperm.

Growth environment of sampled plant
Field, wild. 

Position in forest canopy
Samples include dominant (D), co-dominant (CD) and suppressed (SP) trees

Location where sampled
Twelve study locations located in the Gregg river burn, located 50 km south of Hinton, Alberta, USA.

Vegetation type
Boreal forest

Leaf area index
Measurements using hemispherical photography were made and LAI was estimated from the digital images collected using SLIM software.
