"Sampling strategy","Within the gregg burn, an equal number of ‘good' and ‘poor' stands were identified from field reconnaissance based on the height of the stand (taller = good, shorter = poor).  These categories were confirmed by estimating site index, with “good” sites having a mean SI50 of 15 and “poor” sites having an average SI50 of 10.  At each stand 4 circular plots were randomly located and dbh of all trees within the plot measured.  Of the 4 plots one was randomly selected for sampling.  Trees were identified as Dominant, Co-dominant or suppressed based on their position in the canopy, and one of each class randomly selected for sampling at each site."
"Leaf area","The crown of each sampled tree was collected, and transported to the lab.  A random sample of needles from the upper, middle and lower parts of the crown were subsampled for determination of specific leaf area.  Subsamples were scanned fresh and then dried and weighed to determine speciufic leaf area for each tree.  The rest of the crown was dried at 78 deg C until the mass stabilized and then mass recorded.  Leaf area was determined by multiplying the mass time specific leaf area of the scanned subsample."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from dbh measured with a diameter tape using the formula for the area of a circle."
"Height","Measured using a clinometer and 50m tape in the field before felling.  Crown length was measured using a tape after sampled trees were felled, and used to determine height to the crown base."
"Crown area","After felling crown width was measured on felled trees."
"Biomass","Only the biomass of all needles was measured.  Other biomass components were not measured."
"Growth environment","All trees were sampled from wild stands that developed following the Gregg Burn in 1956.  Most trees (status 0-3) were sampled from plots located at least 100m from the edge created by the nearby forest access road.  There are 15 trees (status=4) that were more or less open grown as they were selected from the edge of the road."
