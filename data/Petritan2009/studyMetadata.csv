"Sampling strategy","A sample of N = 41-44 individual trees per species was randomly recorded, free of apparent damage, growing under a wide gradient of light conditions."
"Leaf area","Each sapling was divided into five horizontal layers of equal height (=1/5 of total length). A subsample of 50 randomly chosen leaves  per layer (when the number was less, we took all leaves) was used for leaf area measurements with the LI-3100 Area Meter (LI-COR, Inc. 1987) and subsequent drying (at 70 C for 3 days) and weighing. For all other leaves, only dry weights were determined. Using the ratio of leaf weight to  leaf area of the subsamples, we calculated for each layer the area of the rest of the leaves. The sum of the leaf areas of the individual layers made up the total leaf area of the sapling"
"Stem cross sectional area","Stem cross sectional area:replace please with (stem area at base) = pi x diameter (at 10 cm above ground) x diameter (at 10 cm above ground) / 4."
"Height","is total height, measured with a tape to the nearest centimeter"
"Crown area","Crown area: is the projected crown area, that was computed an ellipse area (the product of the two crown diameters with pi, divided by 4). The two crown diameters were recorded at the height of the maximal crown width (in N-S and W-E orientation)."
"Biomass","we used only leaf mass, that was obtained by drying and weighing."
"traits","Specific leaf area (SLA in cm2 g-1) is ratio of total leaf area to leaf dry weight. Leaf area index (LAI in cm2 cm-2) as ratio of total leaf area to projected crown area ."
"Growth environment","FW; The study was carried out in a mixed deciduous stand with an overstory of 120-year-old beech and some trees of hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), ash, maple, Norway maple (Acer platanoides), and sessile oak (Quercus petraea)."
"Other variables","Light availability was quantified by taking a hemispherical photo just above the uppermost leaves of every sampled sapling in mid-summer with a Nikon digital camera with fisheye lens and a self-leveling mount. Photos were processed with the Winscanopy software (Regents Instruments Inc., Sainte-Foy, Que?bec 2003). As a measure of light intensity, we used the indirect site factor (ISF) in percent of above canopy light, which is based on diffuse radiation. Under our conditions, this measure proved as a reliable proxy of total growing seasons photosynthetically active radiation as ISF and total site factor (including diffuse and direct radiation) were strongly correlated with R2 = 0.94 and p<0.001."
