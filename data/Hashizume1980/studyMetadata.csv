Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Survey was conducted in the summer of 1978 (Hashizume and Onishi 1980). Sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class and were felled. Diameter at breast height, tree height, and height of the lowest living branch were measured. Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-2.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward. Fresh weights of stem, branches, leaves, and fruits in each layer were measured. "
Height,"Measured after sample trees were felled (Hashizume and Onishi 1980)."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights (Hashizume and Onishi 1980). The ratio was estimated from subsamples from each layer."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
