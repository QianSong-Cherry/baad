"Sampling strategy","Survey was conducted in the summer of 1978 (Hashizume and Onishi 1980). Sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class and were felled. Diameter at breast height, tree height, and height of the lowest living branch were measured. Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-2.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward."
"Height","Measured after sample trees were felled (Hashizume and Onishi 1980)."
"Biomass","Fresh mass of stem, branches, leaves, and fruits in each layer were measured. Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass (Hashizume and Onishi 1980). The ratio was estimated from subsamples from each layer."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Hashizume and Onishi (1980). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
