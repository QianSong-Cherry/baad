"Sampling strategy","The study was conducted in a natural deciduous broadleaf and evergreen conifer mixed forest at the Teshio Experimental Forest, Hokkaido University (Takagi et al. 2010). Forest floor was covered with dense dwarf bamboo. Canopy height was 20 m. A quadrate (15 times 15 m) was created (Suzuki 2012). Diameter at breast height and tree crown width were measured for all trees within the quadrate before the trees were felled. Roots of all trees were excavated at the soil depth of 0 to 70 cm. The soil on roots was completely washed away by spraying water with a compressor. Fine roots were not collected. Multiple-stemmed trees were excluded for this data paper."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Measured after trees were cut down."
"Biomass","The fresh mass of each organ (trunk, branches, leaves, and roots) was weighed. For evergreen conifer species (Abies sachalinensis and Picea jezoensis), fresh mass of trunk, branches without leaves, branches with leaves, and roots was weighed. Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass.  The ratio was estimated from subsample taken from each tree and each organ. A disk of ca. 3 cm thick was taken from the base, middle, and near top heights of trunk for a sampled tree with the DBH > 0.1 m and the fresh mass was measured. For trees with the DBH < 0.1 m, one disk for each tree was obtained at the base of the trunk. Each disk was oven-dried at 70-80 degree C until there was no change in the mass, and the dry mass was measured. The trunk dry mass was then estimated by multiplying its fresh mass by the average dry to fresh mass ratio of the disk samples for each tree. For branches, coarse roots, leaves, (and branches with leaves for coniferous trees), one fresh subsample of > 2 kg (typically 3-6 kg) taken from several heights or depths for each tree was weighed when the total fresh mass of each organ was > 5 kg, while all the sample was used for the subsample when the total fresh mass was < 5 kg. The subsamples were oven-dried at 70-80 degree C until there was no change in the mass. The dry mass was estimated by multiplying the fresh mass by the dry to fresh mass ratio of the subsample for each organ for each tree."
"Other variables","Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
