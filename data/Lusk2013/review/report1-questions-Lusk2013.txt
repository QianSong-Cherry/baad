1. Is your contact information correct?
	If not, could you please provide correct information.
ANSWER: Yes

2. Is your reference information correct?
	If not, could you please provide correct information.
ANSWER: No, its two kinds of wrong. Firstly, data from the three Araliaceae have not been published anywhere (Pseudopanax arboreus, Pseudopanax crassifolius, Schefflera digitata). Second, the data from the other 17 species have been attributed to the wrong paper: it should be Lusk CH, Kaneko T, Grierson E, Clearwater MJ (2013) Correlates of tree species sorting along temperature gradients in New Zealand rainforests: seedling functional traits, growth and shade tolerance. Journal of Ecology 101, 1531–1541.

3. Does the number of records for each variable seem reasonable based on the datafile you provided?
	 For your interest, the raw data file you originally sent us and the cleaned data file are both attached.

7. Is the 'Species data' correct, i.e. name, family, plant functional type (pft)?
	 If not, please provide details where possible.

8. Is the 'Methods' information complete and accurate?
	 If not, could you please provide the missing information in Metadata.csv file attached?
