Sampling strategy,"Sample trees are collected from an age chronosequency of Populus tremuloides natural stands. The sampled stands represent the whole range of site conditions of the species distribution; i.e. from poor to medium and good site productivity. All sample trees were dominant trees."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was not measured. However, we can calculate the leaf area by using specific leaf area of Populus tremuloides to convert the leaf biomass data into leaf area data."
Stem cross sectional area,"We can calculate stem cross sectional area by using the diameter at breast height."
Biomass, "After felling all branches were weighed fresh in the field. Subsamples of the crown (10% of crown for all trees >5 cm DBH and 100% for trees <5 cm DBH) was dried at 70oC for 48h to obtain the dry to fresh weight ratio.
Height,"Because all sample trees were at different ages, they have different height."
