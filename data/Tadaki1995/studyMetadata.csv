Sampling strategy,"Sampled stands were located in the compartment 9-i of the Kyushu Research Center, Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute (FFPRI), Kumamoto, Japan. The stands regenerated from sprouts and seeds after clear cutting in 1940-1950s, located on the middle of the slope (ca. 80 m a.s.l.), and was pure stands of Castanopsis cuspidata with a few Quercus glauca. Sampling was conducted in four plots (plot 2, 4, 6, 8) in December 1967, and in adjecent stands in November 1961, December 1963, November 1965.  Trees in the plots were thinned in the spring of 1961 to the density of 4125 trees/ha for plot 2, 7500 for plot 4, 32100 for plot 6 and 18400 for plot 8. In four plots, trees were selected to cover size ranges. In adjecent stands, all trees within a defined area (5 or 15 square meter) and several large trees outside the area were cut down. After felling tree, tree height, height of the lowest living branch, and stem diameters at breast height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth and separated into stem, branches,  and leaves. Roots were excavated. We only included data of single-stem trees for this data paper."
Leaf area,"Total leaf area was estimated from fresh mass of leaves and leaf area/leaf mass ratios obtained from subsamples. For sampled trees from adjecent stands, average leaf area/leaf mass ratios was used for each sampling. For sampled trees from plots 2, 4, 6, and 8, leaf area/leaf mass ratios of each layer was used. Leaf area was measured by the dot-counting method proposed by Negishi et al. (1957, J. Jp. For. Soc. 39: 380-384) (Tadaki et al. 1962,  J. Jp. For. Soc. 44: 350-359).  Transpalent plate with marked dots at a certian interval such as every 1 cm was placed randomly on a leaf. Leaf area was estimated from the relationship between leaf area and the counted number of dots in the leaf."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured after trees were felled."
Biomass,"Measured fresh mass of each component was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from a subsample taken for a componet at each sampling which were oven-dried at 80 degC (Tadaki 1968, J. Jp. For. Soc. 50: 60-65). Same ratio was used for trees sampled in the same year."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Tadaki (1995). Based on this reference and Tadaki (1962) and Tadaki et al. (1968), meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
