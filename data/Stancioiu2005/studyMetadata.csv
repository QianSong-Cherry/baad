Topic, Description
Sampling strategy, Redwood trees from a range of diameters and crown positions were subjectively sampled.
Leaf area, The photosynthetic tissue was divided into five morphological types and subsamples were scanned for projected leaf area using the Regent Instruments WinSeedle software. Projected leaf area was then expanded from the scanned sample to morphological type, branch level, branch category level within crown section, crown section, entie crown and tree level.
Stem cross sectional area, cross sectional area of stem section including only sapwood in cm2
Height, Tree height from ground to tree top
Growth environment, second-growth redwood forests on coastal sites in Mediterranean environment
