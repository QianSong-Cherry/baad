"Sampling strategy","The late Dr. Kyoji Yoda contributed largely in sampling. All large trees on the 20 m x 20 m sampling plot were cut at ground level in December 1973 (Nagano & Kira 1978). Stem diameter and tree height were measured immediately. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-3.3 m, and at intervals of 2 m upward. Vine species, which were included in the original article, have been excluded in this compilation. Multiple-stemmed trees were also excluded for this data paper."
"Leaf area","Leaf area of each layer was also estimated for each tree by the same sampling procedure, from leaf dry weight and leaf area/leaf dry weight ratios (Nagano & Kira 1978). The ratio was obtained from direct measurement of the projected leaf area of subsampled leaves with an automatic planimeter (Hayashi-Denko AAM-5). For the Abies firma tree, projected shoot silhouette area was obtained by placing shoots on the planimeter. Shoot silhouette area was assumed to be equivalent to total needle projected area for this small tree. This assumption is reasonable because a previous study showed that suppressed Abies trees have the ratio of  shoot silhouette area to needle projected area of 1-1.3 (Sprugel et al. 1996 Tree Physiol. 16:91-98)."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Measured by measuring tape after trees were cut down."
"Biomass","Fresh weights of leaves, branches, and stem were measured separately for each layer and each tree. They were later converted to corresponding oven-dry weights based on smaller subsamples of respective organs taken from each layer and trees (Nagano & Kira 1978) by Dr. Yoda. Subsamples were oven-dried for 85 degreeC."
"Other variables","Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
