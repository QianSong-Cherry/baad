Sampling strategy,"All large trees on the 20 m Ã— 20 m sampling plot were cut at ground level (Nagano & Kira 1978). Stem diameter and tree height were measured immediately. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-3.3 m, and at intervals of 2 m upward. Vine species, which were included in the original article have been ecluded in this compilation."
Leaf area,"Leaf area per stratum and tree were also estimated by the same sampling procedure, based on direct measurement of the sample leaf area with an automatic planimeter (Hayashi-Denko AAM-5) and leaf area/leaf dry weight ratios (Nagano & Kira 1978)."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured by measuring tape after trees were cut down."
Biomass,"Fresh weights of leaves, branches and stem were measured separately for each layer and tree. They were later converted to corresponding oven-dry weights based on smaller samples of respective organs taken from all strata and trees (Nagano & Kira 1978)."
Other variables,"Species name and family names according to the following references:
- Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo
- Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
