"Sampling strategy","Harvest was conducted in a 31-year-old Chamaecyparis obtusa forest in August 1983 (Karizumi and Terada 1984). Sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class. Roots were excavated, separated into soil depth and into very large (diameter >= 5 cm), large (2-5 cm), medium (0.5-2 cm), small (0.2-0.5 cm), fine (< 0.2 cm) roots, and weighted. Fine and small roots were estimated by soil block sampling method."
"Height","Method not reported in Karizumi and Terada (1984) "
"Biomass","Method not reported in Karizumi and Terada (1984),"
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Karizumi and Terada (1984). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
