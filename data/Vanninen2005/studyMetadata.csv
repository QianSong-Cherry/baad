Sampling strategy,"""The sample trees represent a collection from several studies: Vanninen et al. 1996, Mäkelä and Vanninen 1998, Vanninen and Mäkelä (1999,2000,2005). In all studies the sample trees were selected randomly from the composed stem freguency serie of each plot. The selection was futher targeted so that sampling targeted to trees representing dominant, intermediate and supressed trees. """

Height,"""was tape-measured on felled trees"""
Crown area,
Biomass,"""was measurend on the basis of comprehensive empirical biomass analysis, see method from Vanninen et al. 1996"""
