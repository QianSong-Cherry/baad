Sampling strategy,"The sample trees represent a collection from several studies: Vanninen et al. 1996, M채kel채 and Vanninen 1998, Vanninen and M채kel채 (1999,2000,2005). In all studies the sample trees were selected randomly from the composed stem freguency serie of each plot. The selection was futher targeted so that sampling targeted to trees representing dominant, intermediate and supressed trees."
Stem cross sectional area,"Was determined by measuring the stem radials, without bark, of  sampledicks  into four cardinal points at minimum accuracy of 1 mm."
Height," Was tape-measured on felled trees."
Biomass,"Was measurend on the basis of comprehensive empirical biomass analysis, see method from Vanninen et al. 1996. Sample branches were pre-dried, separated into wood, cones and needles and dried at 105oC for 48h to obtain dry weight."
Growth environment,"Data consist from sample trees that are felled from 6 sites of southern Finland, sites represented fertile Myriillus site type and poor Calluna site-type according to Cajander 1949."
