Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,"The sample trees represent a collection from several studies: Vanninen et al. 1996, Mäkelä and Vanninen 1998, Vanninen and Mäkelä (1999,2000,2005). In all studies the sample trees were selected randomly from the composed stem freguency series of each plot. The selection was futher targeted so that sampling targeted to trees representing dominant, intermediate and supressed trees."
Stem cross sectional area,"Was determined as an average of four stem radii under bark, measured from sample disks in four cardinal points at minimum accuracy of 1 mm."
Height, Was tape-measured on felled trees.
Leaf mass,"Leaf mass is based on sample branches taken systematically in the crowns of all trees. A regression model was developed and parameterised separately for subsets of trees, predicting the leaf biomass of each branch from branch diameter and distance from the top."
Branch mass,Branch mass was estimated using the same method as for leaf mass.
Stem sapwood mass,"Disks were taken at several heights of the stem, always including breast height and crown base. Sapwood and heartwood rings were estimated by viewing the disks against light. The cross-sectional area of the disks (both sapwood and heartwood components) was estimated as a circular plate with a diameter that was the average of  two measured perpendicular diameters. The volume of the stem sections between the conscutive disks was calculated as cut cones, and the biomass was obtained using the density of the lower disk, measured by weighing the dry weight and immersion."
Stem heartwood mass,See stem sapwood mass.
Fine root mass,Stand-level estimate of fine root (< 2mm) mass was obtained from soil core samples. Individual-tree fine root estimates were based on dividing the stand level estimate in proportion to basal area.
Coarse root mass,"For coarse root mass, all roots were dug up in a 90 degree sector chosen at random around the tree. Roots were followed up to 0.5 cm thickness. They were cleaned and oven dried."
Foliage area,Specific leaf area was measured from a subsample of foliage to convert foliage mass to foliage area.
Crown length,Crown length was measured from felled trees using a tape measure. Crown base was defined as the height where at least two consecutive dead whorls could be found below the continuous crown.
Crown area,Crown width was measured across the widest diameter and perpendicular to that. The length of the crown above and below its widest point were recorded and crown area was estimated as the area of the two cones defined by crown width and the upper and lower lengths.
