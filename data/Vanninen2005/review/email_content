Dear Daniel,
 
I tried my best with the available time at the moment.
 
What I noticed was that 18 trees is missing from the data of 2005 article (where n= 117).
I put a datafile where these trees are. May its not worth putting these trees into the pictures and this database - these are reported already in Vanninen et al 1996. However from that file consists the ages and sitetypes for 99 trees which are already in that paper and which data is missing.
 
Further I put a map from the locations of our sites.
 
and answers to your attachments are attached.
 
Please ask if and when there are unclear text or definitions.
 
Best regards,
Petteri
