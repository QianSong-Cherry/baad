11. I see in your paper that you provide an average value for canopy openness [average 5.9 +- 0.7%], however we did not get individual information. Would you be willing to share individual-based info in case you have it?
ANSWER: Canopy openness is available only for three individuals per species and therefore would be useless for purpose of a metaanalysis.
