\underline{Reference}: Aiba. M. and Nakashizuka, T. (2005) Sapling structure and regeneration strategy in 18 Shorea species co-occurring in a tropical rainforest. Annals of Botany 96, 313-321.

\underline{Species}: Shorea acuta, Shorea agami, Shorea amplexicaulis, Shorea cf. andulensis, Shorea beccariana, Shorea biawak, Shorea crassa, Shorea curtisii, Shorea exelliptica, Shorea falciferoides ssp. glaucescens, Shorea laxa, Shorea macroptera ssp. baillonii, Shorea ochracea, Shorea ovalis ssp. sarawakensis, Shorea ovata, Shorea pilosa, Shorea scrobiculata, Shorea smithiana.

\underline{Sampling strategy}: Of the approx. 70 species of the genus Shorea that occur in Lambir Hills National Park (Sarawak, Malaysia), 18 species, for which enough saplings of a comparable size could be collected, were analysed - 360 individuals were analysed. In August 2003, approx. 20 sound saplings of various sizes (0.1–1.5m tall) of each species were sampled to determine their allometric relationships. All sampled individuals grew under closed canopies. For S. ochracea, only 18 individuals were sampled because of its rarity. Also sampled were 10–15 saplings of each species excluding S. ochracea, in November 2003.

\underline{Leaf area}: For each sapling, the total leaf area and maximum individual leaf area were measured using the software LIA32 for Windows 95 (K. Yamamoto) after scanning the images.

\underline{Stem cross sectional area}: Stem diameter was measured at ground using calliper at right angles. 

\underline{Height}: Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground to the highest apex.

\underline{Crown area}: Crown width was measured at right angles including the widest width. Projected area and volume were estimated by assuming an ellipse/ellipsoid.

\underline{Biomass}: Saplings were divided into root, stem, branches and leaf lamina. Each compartment was dried to constant weight and weighed. Leaf petioles were not included in Total leaf mass. All parts of the saplings were weighed after being oven-dried at 60oC for at least 5 d.

\underline{traits}: The wood density of mature trees was obtained from literatures on tropical timber (see Reference article for more details). For some species, wood density data were unavailable (S. acuta, S. andulensis, S. biawak, S. crassa, S. laxa and S. pilosa), so the average value for the timber group to which the species belonged was applied.

\underline{Growth environment}: Field, wild.

\underline{Other variables}: Saplings grown under closed canopy and canopy openness were measured using hemispherical photographs; Mean annual rainfall provided; Mean annual temperature provided.
