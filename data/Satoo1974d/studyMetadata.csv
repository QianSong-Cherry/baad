"Sampling strategy","Sampling was conducted in a Metasequoia glyptostroboides plantation (17 years old, 300 m a.s.l.) in Tanashi, Tokyo, Japan. Trees were originated from rooted cuttings of two trees, thus clones.  A plot of size 251 sq. m were created and stem diameter at breast height were measured. Details of the sampling plot are listed in Table 1 of Satoo (1974d). Five sample trees were selected to cover a wide range of diameter and cut down at ground level in late October 1969. Roots were surveyed in middle December of 1969. Sample trees were treated with stratified sampling technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, at intervals of 2 m upward. Stem, branches, and needles were separated for each layer. Branches were further divided into new shoot, older branch > 1 cm in diameter, and that < 1cm. Roots were excavated and fine roots were recovered by spil block method."
"Leaf area","Total projected needle area was estimated from needle fresh mass and the ratio of needle area to fresh mass. Subsample of needles were collected from each layer. Projected needle area was measured with a photoelectric planimeter."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","For aboveground, measured fresh mass of each component in a layer was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken for each layer. For root mass, method was not reported."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Satoo (1974d). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
