Sampling strategy, "Two study areas of 60 km2 (10 x 6 km) were selected representing main ecosystems for the studied dwarf-shrub species, grown at the ecological area of Magellanic steppe in Santa Cruz province, southern Patagonia, Argentina. Three plots (replicates) of 15 x 30 m were randomly located at each study area. Within each plot, five individuals of dominant dwarf-shrub corresponding to different sizes were randomly selected."
Leaf area, "Leaf area (LA) of each individual size was determined by scanning the total harvested leaves per plant. The leaves were spread randomly over a transparent sheet and then scanned using a flat-bed scanner. The leaf area was determined using image analysis software (DT-Scan, Delta-T Ltd., Cambridge, UK)."
 Height, "Before harvesting height was measured with a tape."
Crown area, "Before harvesting, crown dimensions (the crown length at its widest point, CL; the perpendicular crown extent at the same height, CW) of each plant was measured. Crown area (CA) was calculated as CA = 3.1416 x CL/2 x CW/2."
Biomass, "Then, dwarf-shrub plants were separated into the following components: green leaves; senesced leaves; stem and roots classified as fine (diameter <1.0 mm) and coarse (> 1.0 mm). All components from each sampled plant were weighed fresh. Roots from individual plants were excavated to maximum rooting depth for all size classes in circular plots centred on the base of selected plants. Sub samples were taken for oven drying to estimate biomass."
Traits, "Samples of components were dried in a forced draft oven at 65oC to constant weight and ground in a mill containing 1 mm stainless steel screen for nutrient analysis. Nitrogen (N) content was determined using the semi-micro Kjeldahl technique."
Growth environment, "Nardophyllum bryoides dwarf-shrub plants were sampled from a dwarf-shrub grass steppe with vegetation dominated by Festuca gracillima (25-35%) and N. bryoides (20-25%) associated with Nassauvia ulicina, J. chrysophylla, Bromus setifolius, Carex andina, Colobanthus subulatus and J. tridens Nassauvia ulicina dwarf-shrub plants were sampled from a grass steppe with vegetation dominated by F. gracillima (20-30%) associated with J. chrysophylla, B. setifolius, C. andina, N. bryoides, Berberis microphylla and Perezia recurvata. Climate is cold temperate and subhumid with a mean annual temperature of 5.5-7.5oC, a long-term annual rainfall of 175-202 mm evenly distributed throughout the year."
