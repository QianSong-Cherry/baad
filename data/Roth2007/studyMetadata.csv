Sampling strategy, "Within each harvest year, sample trees free of damage and disease, were selected at random from across the diameter distribution representative of each treatment and site. Prior to harvest, an inventory was completed on each sample tree consisting of HT, DBH, diameter at ground line, and crown width at the widest point parallel to, and perpendicular to the planting bed. Sample trees were felled at ground line using a hand saw, placed on a tarp and separated into four aboveground components: foliage, branches, stem and dead branches."

Height,"Total height (HT) was measured on every tree at ages 2 and 3, but was limited to a representative 20% sub-sample at age 5. Individual tree HT at age 5 was determined from site and treatment specific HT versus DBH relationships developed from this sub-sample."
Crown area,""
Biomass,"The total fresh weight of each component was measured separately in the field. The fraction of bark to stem components was estimated from 6 cm disks of wood, cut from the base of each ofthree equally spaced stem segments along the full length of the stem. Bark was separated from each disk and the fresh weight of each was determined in the field. Tissue samples were transported from the field and dried to a constant weight at 70o C. Litter was almost exclusively pine foliage (> 98%) and was separated from other pine material (branch, bark, twigs and cones), oven dried at 70C and weighed to the nearest 0.1 g."
traits,"Needlefall (NF) was collected an average of six times per year over a three year period (June 2003 to February 2007) to estimate leaf area index (projected LAI). Within each family measurement plot, six circular littertraps (1.0 m2 each) were deployed, with half randomly positioned along the bed and inner bed positions. Specific leaf area (m2 g-1) was determined using the volume displacement method (Johnson, 1984) on foliar samples that were collected from individual families in the fall of 2003"
Growth environment,
Other variables,"Annual measurements of DBH were made at ages 2, 3, and 5 years on all trees in the measurement plots."
