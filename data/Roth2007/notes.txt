Latin name of species
Pinus taeda L., Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliotttii

Size range
Diameter at breast height (1.37 m) ranged from 1.3 to 15.2 cm.

Number of individuals
184

Individual leaf size and Total leaf area


Area total stem cross section
Stem diameter was measured at breast height (1.37 m ) and at ground line. 

Projected crown area and crown surface area
Crown width was measured at the widest point parallel to, and perpendicular to the
planting bed.

Total height of plant and Height of crown
Heights were measured for each individual.

Biomass;Total leaf mass, Stem mass and Bark mass
Trees were separated into four aboveground components: foliage, branches, stem and dead branches. The total fresh weight of each component was measured separately in the field. 6 cm disks were cut from the base of each of three equally spaced stem segments along the full length of the
stem. Bark was separated from each disk and the fresh weight of each was determined in the field. Samples of each component was dried to constant weight as to recieve dry weight/wet weight ratio.
