Sampling strategy,"We sampled seedlings of common conifer and angiosperm species, at four temperate rainforest sites in Chile and one in New Zealand, chosen to represent a range of climatic and edaphic conditions. We sampled 15-21 seedlings of each species, ranging in height from 50 to 350 mm tall. Crown architecture of each seedling was recorded using a using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). YPCONVERT, developed by Daniel Falster, was used to convert architecture files to a format compatible with YPLANT."
Leaf area,"The total foliage area of each plant was measured photographically."
Stem cross sectional area,"Basal stem diameter (immediately above any root flanges) was measured on two orthogonal axis, using electronic callipers."
Height,"Height was measured as the length of the longest stem, from the ground to the apex."
Crown area,"Crown area was computed from the plant architecture data obtained using the 3D digitizer."
Biomass,"Saplings were divided into root, stem, and leaf fractions, and then dried to a constant weight. Leaf petioles were included in total leaf mass."
traits,"Three of the 18 species are heteroblastic i.e. undergo significant ontogenetic changes in leaf morphology. Accordingly we digitized two or three different leaf shapes for each of these species (Myrceugenia, Aextoxicon, Phyllocladus) and used whichever was most appropriate for each plant."
Growth environment,"Field, wild."
Other variables,"Mean annual temperature and soil N, P and C data are provided. A Nikon Coolpix digital camera (Nikon Corporation, Japan) with a 182 degree fisheye adapter was used to take a hemispherical photograph directly above each seedling."
