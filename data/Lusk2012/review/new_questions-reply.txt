Questions about the study:  Lusk2012 

1. Could you please indicate the status (in terms of shading) of your sampled stands? Please answer using one of the following categories: 0 = supressed, 1 = intermediate, 2 = codominant (crown partly exposed), 3 = dominant (crown fully exposed). We'd appreciate if you could ansewr in this file and return it to us. ANSWER: I don't understand the question. How can a "stand" be dominant, suppressed etc? These are conditions of individual plants. The seedlings in this paper were growing in a range of forest understorey light environments, ranging from margins to shaded understories.
