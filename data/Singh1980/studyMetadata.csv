"Sampling strategy","Sample trees were felled in a 15 year old teak plantation in Shikarganj Block, compartment number 15A, the Chandraprabha Sanctuary, India in 1976-1977. Sampled trees were selected to represent different size classes. Trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth. Stem, branches, leaves were seperated for each layer. Roots were dug out from one cubic meter volume and adhering soil was removed."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh weight of each component was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from uniform representative subsamples of weight ranging between 100 and 500g. These subsamples were weighed for fresh weight and then oven-dried to constant weight at 70 deg C for 48 h, and dry weight were measured."
"Other variables","M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Singh et al. (1980). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara."
