Latin name of species
Pinus taeda

Size range
Stem diameter at breast height (1.37 m) ranged from 4 to 14 cm.

Number of individuals
27

Area of sapwood, heartwood cross section and/or total stem cross section
Diameter of stems were measured at breast height (1.37 m) on each individual prior to felling. Outside bark diameter and bark thickness was measured on each stem 1 m section after felling. 

Total height of plant and Height of crown
Total height and height to live crown was measured on each individual prior to felling.

Biomass;Total leaf mass, Stem mass and Branch mass
Trees were divided into stem, branches, non-foliated branches, twigs and foliage. Each stem was then divided into 1 m stem sections. Fresh weight of each section was weighed in the field and random subsamples were dried to constant weight and weighed.

Latin name of species
Pinus taeda

Size range
Stem diameter at breast height (1.37 m) ranged from 8.9 to 25.9 cm.

Number of individuals
65

Individual leaf size and Total leaf area
Projected leaf area of fresh needle samples were made using an optical planimeter (LiCor model LI-3000). Total leaf area was calculated using leaf mass and SLA for each crown section. Sections where then summed to obtain tree total leaf area.

Area of sapwood, heartwood cross section and/or total stem cross section
Stem diameter at breast height (1.37 m) was measured prior to felling.

Projected crown area 
Maximum and minimum crown diameters were measured and then averaged to get mean crown width. Projected crown area was then calculated by assuming a circular horizontal area.

Total height of plant and Height of crown
Total height and height to the base of the live crown were measured prior to felling.

Biomass;Total leaf mass, Stem mass and Branch mass
Trees were divided into stem, branches, non-foliated branches, twigs and foliage. Each stem was then divided into 1 m stem sections. Fresh weight of each section was weighed in the field and random subsamples were dried to constant weight and weighed.

Leaf mass per area
Specific leaf area was determined from a subsample of 20 needle fascicles, from both current year and second year foliage, from each crown section. SLA was calculated from projected leaf area and leaf mass.

Plant functional type
Evergreen gymnosperm.

Growth environment of sampled plant
Plantation managed.

Location where sampled
The Mississippi State University school forest in Winston County, MS.

Longitude and latitude of location
33∞16'N, 88∞52'W.

Vegetation type
Boreal forest.

Mean annual rainfall
1430 mm.

Mean annual temperature
Min 11∞C to max 23∞C.
