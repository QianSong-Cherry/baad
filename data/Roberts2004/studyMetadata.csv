Sampling strategy, "From the crowns of harvested trees, all live branches were removed from each 1-meter section and separated into current year foliage and subtending twigs, and previous year?s foliage and twigs. The total fresh weight of each of the components was recorded. A random subsample of each component was weighed fresh and retained for laboratory analysis. Approximately 20 needle fascicles from both current-year and second-year foliage were collected from each crown section and returned to the lab for determination of specific leaf area (SLA). In the laboratory, subsamples were dried to a constant weight and weighed to determine fresh mass:dry mass ratios for each component in each section. Foliage was separated from twigs to determine foliage mass:wood mass ratios for each component in each section. "
Leaf area, "Leaf area was not estimated"
Stem cross sectional area,"Stem cross sectional areas were determined from stem diameters taken at stump height (0.3 m), 1 m, 1.37 m, and every 1 m interval up the stem. Stem diameters were measured using a diameter tape."
Height,"Stem heights were measured on standing trees prior to felling using a clinometer to measure from the base of the stem to the tallest point on the stem. Stem height was measured again after felling by stretching a tape along the length of the stem."
Crown area,"Crown projection area (CPA), the horizontal area of crown coverage, was calculated as the area of a circle with a diameter equal to mean crown width. Prior to felling, crown diameter on two axes (maximum and minimum) were measured by stretching a tape between the estimated crown edges as estimated by an observer standing several meters back from the tree.The two crown diameters were averaged to get the mean crown diameter."
Biomass,"Total dry mass of woody components (stem, branches, twigs) were determined for each 1 meter section of all destructively sampled trees. Fresh weights were determined in the field, subsamples were taken, dried at 80oC, and weighed to determine total dry mass of each component."
Traits,"Height to the base of the live crown was determined prior to felling by using a clinometer to measure the height to the lowest branches in the "predominant" crown, i.e., disregarding individual branches that occassionally occur well below the majority of the live crown. Crown length was determined by subtracting the height to base of live crown from the total height of the tree."
