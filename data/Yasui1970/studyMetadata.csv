"Sampling strategy","Forty-eight trees were selectively cut in a Quercus myrsinaefolia coppice forest (Shimoyamasa, Hirose cho, Shimane Prefecture, Japan) in November 1969.  Prior to this selective cut, the forest was selectivelycut in 1959, 1962, and 1966. By the first selective cut in 1959, the forest was made into nearly pure stand of Quercus myrsinaefolia. Within 48 felled trees, 16 sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them at the interval of 0.74 m and stem discs were collected. Branches and leaves were separated from stem in each 0.74 m layer and weighted for the fresh mass."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh mass of each component (stem, branch, and leaves) was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken. About 4 kg of branches or leaves were used for subsample. For stem, discs were used for subsamples. Subsamples were oven-dried at 105 degC for 24 h. The ratio was 0.72-0.84 for stem, 0.51 and 0.45 for branches and leaves, in average."
"Other variables","M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Yasui and Fujie (1970). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
