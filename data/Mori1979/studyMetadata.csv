"Sampling strategy","Sample trees were felled in three Fagus crenata dominant stands and in one 12-years-old Cryptomeria japonica plantation in 1970s (Mori et al. 1979). The secondary Fagus stand was assumed to have been cut in 30-40 years before the survey. The natural forest on flat topology was assumed to have been selectively cut in 50 years before and that on slope have been never cut for the past 100 years. The Sample trees were selected to represent size variation of each stand. Sample trees were cut at ground level. Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-2 m and at intervals of 2 m upward for the Fagus stands and 0-1m and and at intervals of 2 m upward for the Cryptomeria stand."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not written."
"Biomass","Dry mass of stem, branches, and leaves were obtained (Mori et al. 1979). Details were not reported."
"Other variables","M.I. Ishihara,  H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Mori et al. (1979). Meta data was also created by M.I. Ishihara based on Mori et al. (1979). Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
