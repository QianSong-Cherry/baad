  abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIMS:} Crown structure and above-ground biomass investment was studied in relation to light interception of trees and lianas growing in a 6-month-old regenerating forest. {METHODS:} The vertical distribution of total above-ground biomass, height, diameter, stem density, leaf angles and crown depth were measured for individual plants of three short-lived pioneers ({SLPs)}, four long-lived pioneers ({LLPs)} and three lianas. Daily light interception per {individual\{Phi\}} d was calculated with a canopy model. The model was then used to estimate light interception per unit of leaf mass ({\{Phi\}leaf} mass), total above-ground mass ({\{Phi\}mass)} and crown structure efficiency (Ea, the ratio of absorbed vs. available light). {KEY} {RESULTS:} The {SLPs} Trema and Ochroma intercepted higher amounts of light per unit leaf mass ({\{Phi\}leaf} mass) because they had shallower crowns, resulting in higher crown use efficiency (Ea) than the other species. These {SLPs} (but not Cecropia) were also taller and intercepted more light per unit leaf area ({\{Phi\}area).} {LLPs} and lianas had considerably higher amounts of leaf mass and area per unit above-ground mass ({LMR} and {LAR}, respectively) and thus attained {\{Phi\}mass} values similar to the {SLPs} ({\{Phi\}mass=\{Phi\}areaxLAR).} Lianas, which were mostly self-supporting, had light interception efficiencies similar to those of the trees. {CONCLUSIONS:} These results show how, due to the trade-off between crown structure and biomass allocation, {SLPs}, and {LLPs} and lianas intercept similar amount of light per unit mass which may contribute to the ability of the latter two groups to persist.},
