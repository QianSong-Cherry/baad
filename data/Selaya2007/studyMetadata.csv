"Sampling strategy","A plot of 0.7 ha was established in a 0.5 y/o secondary forest at a minimal distance of 20 m from the edge of this forest stand (beyond this there was primary forest). Ten to 20 individuals (all had grown from seed) per species were selected such that bracketed the height range at which each occurred in the plot."
"Leaf area","Digital photographs of a representative sample of leaves were taken to obtain leaf area using the software Sigma Scan Pro 5. Specific leaf area was used to calculate total leaf area."
"Stem cross sectional area","Calculated from diameter measurements at .3 and 1.3 m height"
"Height","Trees were cut at the base allowing direct height measurements"
"Crown area"," Crown diameter was measured visually in two directions"
"Biomass","Individuals were harvested and clipped into 25 cm segments. Stems branches,  and foliage were put in separate bags. Fresh material was then dried at 70oC for about 5 days and weighed."
"Traits","Wood density: green volume by water displacement and then dry weight; Leaf angle using protractor; Leaf N; Tree LAI measured with a LI2000 content with Kjehldahl destruction"
"Growth environment","Light measurements using quantum sensors and relative light distribution in the canopy calculated from the leaf area distribution measured using the point method (i.e. raising a telescopic pole and counting leaf contacts)"
