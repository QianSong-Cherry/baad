Sampling strategy,"In August 1979, 17 sample trees in a quadrate (15 m times 10 m) of a 53 year-old plantation were cut down. The stand was facing the north-east with slope of 13 to 20 degree. Five trees were selected to represent each diameter class. These five trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward to the crown base and in horizontal layers of each whorl from crown base to the stem apex. For the remaining 12 tress, stems were cut into parts contained in horizontal layer or 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, and at intervals of 3.65 m upward to the crown base, and in horizontal layers of each whorl from crown base to the stem apex."
Leaf area,"Not measured."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Metadata not available."
Crown area," Not measured."
Biomass,"For stem biomass, fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken from each tree at each layer. For branch and leaf biomass, total fresh weight of branches and leaves were converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. Then, dry weight of branches and leaves were converted to branch dry weight and leaf dry weight by the ratio of leaf to branch dry weights. Both ratios were estimated from subsamples taken from each tree at each whorl. All samples were oven-dried at 90 degrees C for 96 hours."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
