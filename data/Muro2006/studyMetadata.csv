"Sampling strategy","Sampling was conducted in a 32-38 year-old Quercus acutissima stand. Eight sample trees in a 20 m times 20 m quadrate were cut at ground level. Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 3 m depth and stem, branches, and leaves were seperated for each layer. Roots of larger four trees among the sampled trees were excavated, and the soils were removed. Some remained roots in the soil were also excavated. Fine roots (0-0.5 cm in diameter) were also included in the sample."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Biomass","Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples oven-dried at 85-90 degree C."
"Other variables","M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Muro et al. (2006). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
