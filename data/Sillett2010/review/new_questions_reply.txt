Here are answers and some comments:

A. Sampling strategy: Dominant and co-dominant trees of 3 height classes were selected for detailed study from the tallest conifer-dominated and angiosperm-dominated forests including the tallest known individuals. Each tree's main trunk and all appendages were mapped nondestructively in a 3D framework and then re-mapped exactly 1 year later to quantify growth. Increment cores were collected at multiple heights along main trunk, and destructive sampling of appendages allowed determination of minimum tree age, biomass, aboveground structure, and annual growth.

B. Traits: total mass, bark volume, sapwood volume, heartwood volume, dead volume, bark area, cambium area, heartwood deposition area, projected leaf area, leaf dry mass, # leaves, LMA, N content

C. Other variables: mass growth, volume growth, % heartwood growth, radial growth, appendage growth, height growth, light availability, leaf size, minimum tree age


2. Yes, I can provide a status rating for each tree, though I worry that these categories are insufficiently well defined to permit meaningful inference. Also, if you are not screening these data yourselves, how do you check for errors? Some of those scatterplots you sent in the last message were really obvious errors, so I am surprised you did not notice them. Your cm2 question also makes me wonder how well you have screened the data for errors. If you read the study's title, you would have known the trees were tall, so their entire bark surface area would be hundreds to thousands of square METERS, not square centimeters.
