Sampling strategy, "Dominant and co-dominant trees of 3 height classes were selected for detailed study from the tallest conifer-dominated and angiosperm-dominated forests including the tallest known individuals. Each tree's main trunk and all appendages were mapped nondestructively in a 3D framework and then re-mapped exactly 1 year later to quantify growth. Increment cores were collected at multiple heights along main trunk, and destructive sampling of appendages allowed determination of minimum tree age, biomass, aboveground structure, and annual growth."
Leaf area, "Leaf area was quantified by a hierarchical subsampling procedure involving 100 % inventory of all branches on the tree. This was accomplished by climbing trees and mapping their crowns. A random sample of branches stratified by height and diameter was then destructively sampled and equations were developed to predict whole-branch quantities using data obtained during crown mapping. Leaf mass was converted to leaf area by scanning subsamples of leaves to determine SLA."
Stem cross sectional area,"Stem cross sectional areas were measured at multiple heights via tape during crown mapping. Increment cores collected from the trunks yielded data on bark, sapwood, and heartwood radii."
Height,"Height was measured directly by lowering a fiberglass tape from highest leaves to average ground level."
Crown area,"Crown area was determined from 8 crown radii per tree."
Biomass,"Biomass was determined by hierarchical sampling beginning with 100% inventory of all aboveground structures followed by subsampling. 3D computer models ensured that there were no errors in XYZ coordinates of all woody elements in the tree. Destructive sampling, including increment coring, yielded bark, sapwood, and heartwood radii for all woody components. Subsamples were measured fresh and then dried and weighed to determine densities."
