Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Leaf area and weight data collected for 87 Nothofagus solandri individuals at Craigieburn, South Island, New Zealand. Data collected January to April 2007 from three distinct age classes (25, 40 and 135 years old). All stands were located on similar slopes, aspects and altitudes"
Leaf area,"For each tree, total leaf area, and average individual leaf area were measured using ImageJ software to analyse scanned images "
Leaf biomass,Total leaf biomass was determined by seperating the leaf component (including petioles) and drying it at 60 degrees for at least three days
Leaf mass per area,LMA calculated as the average across the entire plant
Individaul leaf area,Average leaf area for an individual leaf was aceraged across the entire plant
Growth environment,Natural forest
Stem cross sectional area,"Stem diameter was measured at ground using calliper at right angles, and at breast height (1.35m) using stem diameter tape"
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground to the highest apex.
Other variables,Further data exist on the stand development sequence from which these data were obtained. See Holdaway et al. 2008 Functional Ecology 22: 460-469 and references therein.
