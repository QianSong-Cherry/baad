"Sampling strategy"," Sixteen Cryptomeria japonica trees with stem diameter ranging from 6 to 52 cm were cut at ground level (Kawanabe and Ando 1988). Additionally, 37 broadleaved trees were cut. Stem diameter and tree height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m thickness for Cryptomeria japonica, 2 m thickness for Castanea crenata, and 0.5 m thickness for other broadleaved tree species."
"Stem cross sectional area"," Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height"," Measured by measuring tape after trees were felled."
"Biomass"," Fresh weights of leaves, branches and stem were measured separately for each layer and tree (Kawanabe and Ando 1988). In Cryptomeria japonica, leaves and green braches were difficult to seperate. Green parts of the main axis of the stem or large branches were treated as branch and those of lateral axes as leaves. Subsamples of each organ from each layer and each tree were taken and oven-dried at 80 degrees C for 48 hours or more. The dry-to-fresh weight ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry weight of each tree component."
"Growth environment"," Natural forest dominated by Cryptomeria japonica."
"Other variables","Species name and family names were converted by M.I. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
