Topic,Description
Sampling strategy, "16 Cryptomeria japonica trees with stem diameter ranging from 6 to 52 cm were cut at ground level. Additionally, 37 broadleaved trees were cut. Stem diameter and tree height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m thickness for Cryptomeria japonica, 2 m thickness for Castanea crenata, and 0.5 m thickness for other broadleaved tree species."
Leaf area,
Stem cross sectional area, "Estimated from stem diameter."
Height, "Measured by measuring tape."
Crown area,
Biomass, "Fresh weights of leaves, branches and stem were measured separately for each layer and tree. Subsamples of each organ were taken and oven-dried. The fresh-to-dry weight ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry weight of each tree component."
traits,
Growth environment, "Natural forest dominated by Cryptomeria japonica."
