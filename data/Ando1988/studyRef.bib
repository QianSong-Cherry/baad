	abstract = {A natural Cryptomeria japonica stand in Kyoto University Forest located at northern east part of Kyoto prefecture was studied for itâ€™s biomass and stem growth. The study plot was near ridge at about 750 m above sea level. The results are as follows (1) The stand contained 2247 trees over 5 cm DBH per hectare, and basal area was 74.1 m2ha-1. 68% of trees and 85% of basal area were Cryptomeria japonica, and others were broadleaved trees in 13 species. (2) Biomass of Cryptomeria japonica was estimated based on allometric correlations between tree dimensions and dry weight of trees derived from destructive sampling. Stem biomass of Cryptomeria japonica amounted to 176.8 t/ha in dry weight and 456.2 m^3/ha in volume with bark. Branch was 24.5 t/ha and leaf was 23.3 t/ha. (3) The annual increment of stem of Cryptomeria japonica was determined by stem analysis and amounted to 5.35 t/ha/y in dry weight (13.8 m^3/ha/y in volume). (4) Among the 7 years from 1980 to 1987, the basal area of Cryptomeria japonica increased at the average rate 0.83 m^2/ha/y but the basal area of broadleaved trees decreased in 7 years by the death of suppressed trees. It is supposed that the ratio of biomass of Cryptomeria japonica in this stand will gradually increase.},
