"Sampling strategy","Before each sampling campaign tree height and tree circumference were measured on three inner plots which contained 25 tree positions for each fertilization regime (excluding 2 buffer rows). Eight trees covering the range of basal area were destructively sampled at each age for each fertilization regime. The mass of each tree component was measured on-site and sub-samples were dried until constant weight at 65 C to estimate the dry mass of each tree component. Allometric relationships were then established and applied to stand inventory."
"Leaf area"," The green crown length of the sampled trees was divided into three equal-length sections (lower, middle and upper). All leaves of each section were removed and weighed. Thirty leaves were randomly selected in each section, and their fresh mass and area were immediately measured. These leaves were then dried at 65 C and the dry weight of each sub-sample was used in conjunction with its measured area to calculate the specific leaf area (SLA) for each crown section. The dry weight of leaves in each section was multiplied by the SLA value to estimate the leaf area in each tree section. Total tree leaf area was estimated summing the leaf area of the 3 sections."
"Stem cross sectional area","Stem circumference over bark was measured at breast height (1.30 m). After felling,  a disc of stem was cut at a height of 1.30 m and the bark was removed. The circumference under bark was measured on the disc and the stem cross sectional areas over bark and under bark were calculated from the measurements of stem circumference. Colored water was passed under pressure through a piece of trunk at 1.30 m above the ground to determine the sapwood area for a subsample of the trees to establish an allometric relationship that was applied to the other trees."
"Height"," Tree height was measured after felling with a measuring tape."
"Crown area","Crown diameter in the planting row and in the inter-row were measured before felling using a plumb to estimate the position of the leaves the farthest from the trunk. Crown area was estimated considering that the crown was circular."
"Biomass","Biomass was measured destructively for each tree component. All the leaves and branches were weighed in situ and a sub-sample was dried at 65 C to estimate the dry matter of each tree component."
"Traits","Specific leaf area (SLA) was measured in each third of the crown (lower, middle and upper) of the sampled trees. All leaves of each section were removed and weighed. Thirty leaves were randomly selected in each section, and their fresh mass and area were immediately measured. These leaves were then dried at 65 C and the dry weight of each sub-sample was used in conjunction with its measured area to calculate the specific leaf area (SLA) for each crown section."
