At what height the cross-section measurements for sapwood, heartwood, bark and total stem were taken (soil, breast height, crown base)? 

Could you please confirm if what you call h.c is crown depth or height of the plant to the first bearing leaf?

It seems that the units you provided for crown.area (a.cp) might be wrong. You provided m2 but we suspect there is a wrong calculation in the original excel file. Could you please double-check this information?
