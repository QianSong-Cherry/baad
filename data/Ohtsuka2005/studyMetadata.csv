"Sampling strategy","The study site is in the Takayama Forest Research Station, Institute for Basin Ecosystem Studies, Gifu University (Ohtsuka et al. 2005). One-hector permanent plot with a flux tower was created in a secondary deciduous broad-leaved forest on a west-facing slope (1395-1425 m a.s.l.). Forest floor was covered by dense dwarf bamboo. In December 1988, 24 trees were felled at the ground level near the plot. Each tree was separated into a stem and branches. There was no leaf because sampling was conducted in winter. Each stem was cut into segments at the height of 0.3 m, 1.3 m, 2.3 m height, and an interval of 2 m upward. For seven of the sampled trees, coarse roots were excavated."
"Height","Measured by measuring tape after the trees were felled."
"Biomass","Fresh weights of stem segments, branches, and coarse roots were measured (Ohtsuka et al. 2005). Measured fresh weights were converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from subsamples of stem segments, branches, and roots which were collected from each sampled tree and were oven-dried at 80 degrees C. For stem subsamples, a disc was collected at 0.3 m, 1.3 m, 2.3 m height, and an interval of 2 m upward. Branches subsamples were collected from several branches for each tree and the averaged ratio was used. For root subsample, a disc was collected at the most basal part of roots."
"Other variables","Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
