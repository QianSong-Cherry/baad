Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"The study site is in the Takayama Forest Research Station, Institute for Basin Ecosystem Studies, Gifu University (Ohtsuka et al. 2005). One hector permanent plot with a flux tower was set in a secondary deciduous broad-leaved forest on a west-facing slope (1395-1425 m a.s.l.). Forest floor was covered by dense dwarf bamboo. In December 1988, 24 trees were harvested at the ground level near the plot. For seven of the sampled trees, coarse roots were excavated. Fresh weight of stem, branches, and coarse roots were measured. There was no leaf because sampling was conducted in winter."
Height,"Method unknown."
Biomass," Measured fresh weights of stem, branch, and coarse roots were converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights (Ohtsuka et al. 2005). The ratio was estimated from subsamples which were oven-dried at 80 degrees C."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
