Sampling strategy,"In a natural tropical forest site, a 12-ha plot was mapped for trees with a stem diameter 3 10 cm at 1.30 m above ground level (d.b.h.), and a central 1.5-ha plot was mapped for trees with a stem diameter < 10 cm, but with a height greater than 0.50 m. For each species, we selected 20 of the inventoried individuals that were less than 4 m tall, ensuring that the full range of light levels within the site was represented. The crowns of taller individuals could only be studied from neighbouring trees (climbed using spikes or alpinist ropes). Because only a few of the inventoried individuals were accessible in this way, we included a selection of the accessible > 25 m trees (Vouacapoua, 25, 35 and 37 m, and Dicorynia, 26 and 37 m) from the adjacent area outside the plots."
Leaf area,"Leaves were counted on all individuals, and for the bigger trees we did this by climbing carefully along the length of these individuals. Leaf area was determined (Delta Image Analysis System, Eijkelkamp 1991) as the mean value for 20 leaves taken from random positions in the crown. Total leaf area per trees was then calculated as the product of the number of leave and the average leaf area."
Stem cross sectional area, "The stem diameter at 1.3 was used to calculate the stem cross section area assuming a circular area."
Height,"Height was measured by keeping a centimeter from the top of the crown down to the ground, at equal height as the stem base."
Crown area,"Crown widths were measured in two perpendicular directions using a centimeter for small plant (up to 4 meters), and a Suunto clinometer for taller trees. Assuming a elliptoid crown surface area, we estimated the crown surface area."
Biomass,Total leaf biomass was measured as the product of the total number of leaves and the average leaf dry weight.
Traits, Leaf traits were sampled for a subsample of 20 leaves per tree.
Other variables, Hemispherical photographs were made to estimate the light condition as the canopy openness percentrage per tree.
