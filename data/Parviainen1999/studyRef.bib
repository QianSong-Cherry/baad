  abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyse the above-ground structure of birch (Betula pendula) for testing structural hypotheses used in process-based growth models. 12 dominant trees from stands of different height were measured for foliage, branch and stem biomass and crown structure.  Allometric functions were derived to predict leaf mass, lear area and branch mass from cross-sectional area at breast height and crown base as well as from crown length and crown surface area.},
