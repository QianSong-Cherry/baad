Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted in three Quercus myrsinaefolia forests (Takae, Hakuta village, Shimane Prefecture, Japan, ca. 300 m a.s.l.) in October 1970. These forests were regenerated from sprouts after clear cutting. The forest ages were 8, 15, and 25 years old for plot 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them at the interval of 0.74 m and stem discs were collected. Branches and leaves were separated from stem in each 0.74 m layer and weighted for the fresh mass."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Method not reported."
Biomass,"Measured fresh mass of each component (stem, branch, and leaves) was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples taken. About 4 kg of branches or leaves were used for subsample. For stem, discs were used for subsamples. Subsamples were oven-dried at 105 degC for 24 h."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Yasui and Fujie (1970). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
