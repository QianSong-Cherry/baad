Topic, Description
Sampling strategy, "Three individuals of each species were harvested from each light treatment."
Leaf area, "Leaf area was measured with a portable LI-COR Model 3000 area meter (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) before drying."
Stem cross sectional area,
Height, "Length and diameter of all stems, branches, and petioles, and the surface area of all leaves were measured as soon as the plants had two to three fully developed leaves." 
Crown area,
Biomass,"Leaves, petioles, stems, branches, and roots of each plant were dried to a constant mass at 708C. The aboveground biomass of each plant was then calculated from allometric relationships obtained in parallel, destructive measurements carried out in replicate seedlings. The process was repeated on the very same plants each month for fast-growing plants and every two months for slow-growing plants in order to calculate the aboveground biomass increase as a function of time."

Growth environment, "Field Experimental. Seeds of 16 tropical rainforest shrub species belonging to the genus Psychotria (Rubiaceae) were planted in 50-L pots containing a 50:50 mixture of forest topsoil and river sand. Pots were placed in a screened growing house at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute Station on Barro Colorado Island (BCI, Panama). Plants were maintained under natural air temperature and relative humidity, and were watered daily with an automatic irrigation system. Three light environments were created with neutral density shade cloth, providing a range of total daily photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) similar to those experienced by natural populations."
Other variables,"Seven variables were considered: leaf mass per unit area, leaf area ratio (total leaf surface area per whole plant mass, m2/kg), supporting biomass (percentage of aboveground plant mass represented by petioles, branches, and stems), root:shoot ratio (root mass per shoot mass, g/g), photosynthetic capacity (Amax, mmol CO2/m2/s2), dark respiration (mmol O2/m2/s2), and aboveground relative growth rate (RGR, mg/g2/wk2)."
