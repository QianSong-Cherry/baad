Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted in a natural forest that had experienced selective cutting at Takaragawa forest hydrological station, Gumma prefecture, Japan during the end of July  to early August of 1954 and 1955. Trees were selected from each diameter class. Trees were cut down at the ground level and all leaves were detached."
Leaf area,"For leaf area of conifers in reference no. = 37 and 40, probably projected area was measured. For those in reference no. = 9, 15, 28, 31, 52, and 60, projected area was measured."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was estimated from dry mass of leaves and the average ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass reported in Morisawa and Taira (1957). The ratio was obtained from 10 leaves randomly selected from each of 13 sampled trees. Ten leaves were traced on a paper and then the area was obtained by planimeter."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured by measuring tape."
Crown area,"Crown area was estimated from a crown projection map."
Biomass,"Fresh mass of leaves were measured for each tree. The dry to fresh mass ratio was obtained for each of 13 sampled tree from subsamples. Ten randomly-selected subsample leaves were weighted for the fresh mass and oven-dried for 70 degreeC until the mass became constant. The average ratio of 13 trees (0.463) reported in Morisawa and Taira (1957) was used to convert fresh mass to dry mass by M. Ishihara."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara,  H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Morisawa and Taira (1957). Meta data was also created by M. Ishihara based on Morisawa and Taira (1957). Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
