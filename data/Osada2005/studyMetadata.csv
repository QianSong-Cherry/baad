Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,"A 30 * 50-m plot was established in the study area.  All R. trichocarpa >0.5 m tall inside this plot were marked, and tree height, diameter of the main trunk at 10% of the height, and the width and depth of each crown were measured. "
Leaf area,"The numbers of branches and leaves were counted. The lengths of the rachis and petiole of all leaves were measured for all trees 0.5-3 m tall and subsampled in trees >3 m tall. Furthermore, 30 leaves were randomly collected, the lengths of the rachis and petiole were measured, and leaf area was calculated by using the image analysis software NIH image."
Stem cross sectional area,"All R. trichocarpa >0.5 m tall inside this plot were marked, and diameter of the main trunk at 10% of the height was measured."
Height,"All R. trichocarpa >0.5 m tall inside this plot were marked, and tree height was measured."
Crown area,"All R. trichocarpa >0.5 m tall inside this plot were marked,and the width and depth of each crown were measured. Widths were measured at the widest part of the crown and perpendicular to it. The projected area of the crown was calculated as an ellipse based on these two measurements. "
Biomass,"Tree height and trunk diameter were measured for 23 trees of various heights (0.6 _ 8.2 m) outside the plot, and these trees were harvested to measure the total stem biomass after drying at 70oC. Based on these samples, allometric equations were constructed to estimate the total stem biomass from diameter and height. Furthermore, 30 leaves were randomly collected, the lengths of the rachis and petiole were measured, and leaf area was calculated by using the image analysis software NIH image (National Institute of Health, Maryland, USA) for digitized data of photocopies of the leaves. Mass of the leaf petiole plus rachis was then measured after drying. To convert leaf area to leaf mass, two to three leaflets were collected from trees inside the plots. The area and dry mass of each leaflet were measured, and the mean specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated for each individual tree. "

Growth environment,"Seventy-eight trees 1.0-2.5 m tall were randomly selected inside the plot, and hemispherical photographs were taken above the apex of these trees with a CoolPix 910 digital camera with an FC-E8 fisheye converter (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). An indirect site factor (ISF) was calculated with Hemiview ver. 2.1 (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). "
