Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"The survey was conducted in a Distylium racemosum dominated primary evergreen broadleaved forest (aspect: south, slope: ca. 10 degrees) at Mt. Arase, Osumi Peninsula, Kyushu, Japan during October 19th to 29th, 1958 (Kitazawa et al. 1959). Nine trees of various sizes were cut at ground level."
Leaf area,"Leaf area of a tree was estimated from dry mass of leaves and the ratio of leaf area to dry mass. Dry mass was estimated from fresh mass of leaves. "
Height,"Method not reported."
Biomass,"Fresh mass of leaves and woody parts (branches and stem) were measured at the field. Fresh mass of woody parts were only measured for six trees. They were converted to dry mass from the fresh to dry mass ratio. The ratio was estimated from subsamples."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Kitazawa et al. (1959). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
