Questions about the study:  Kohyama1990 

1. Could you please categorize the species from your study according to our categories for plant functional type (pft) and family? pft categories: EA = evergreen angiosperm; DA = deciduous angiosperm; EG = evergreen gymnosperm; DG = deciduous gymnosperm 

2. Could you also classify your plant stands (or species) according to our status categories? status categories: 0 = supressed, 1 = intermediate, 2 = codominant (crown partly exposed), 3 = dominant (crown fully exposed) 

RE: sampled saplings are all from closed canopy stands so that I put category 0; their maximum stature is also shown.
