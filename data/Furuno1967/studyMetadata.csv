Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Survey was conducted in early to mid August 1966 in compartment 9 and 11 (Furuno and Kawanabe 1967). Slopes of these plots were 37 and 35 degrees, respectively. Abies firma and Tsuga sieboldii was overspred with the broadlef species in compartment 9. Abies firma was dominant in compartment 11. Sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class. Sample trees were felled at the base, and diameter at breast height, tree height, height and diameter of the lowest living branch were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m thickness. Fresh weight of stem, branches, and leaves in each layer were measured."
Height,"Method not reported."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from subsamples (Furuno and Kawanabe 1967)."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
