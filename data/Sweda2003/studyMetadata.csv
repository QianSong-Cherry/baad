"Topic","Description"
"Sampling strategy","Sampling was in a deciduous broadleaf secondary forest in the Komenono Forest Research Center of Ehime University, Japan. Trees were felled down and aboveground was separated into stem, branches, and leaves. Roots were excaveted or the soil on roots was washed away by spraying water."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples. Biomass of lost roots was estimated from the root diameter of the end point of the remaining root and the allometric equation W = a* d ^b where W was dry weight (g) of a root with basal root diameter of d (mm). This equation was obtained excavated root for each species. This estimation was used for lost root whose basal daimeter was >= 5 mm. Lost root biomass was only 2.8 % of the total root biomass in average."
"Other variables","M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Sweda and Shimokawa (2003). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
