Sampling strategy,"Five age classes of Douglas-fir and 4 age classes of ponderosa pine were studied. Locations with different impacts (natal regeneration, planted thinned, planted) across the state of Oregon were sampled. Trees were felled and had the center of the internodes marked. Internodes were just distal to branch whorls at increasing number of nodes."
