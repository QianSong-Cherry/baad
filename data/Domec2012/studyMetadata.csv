Sampling strategy,"Five age classes of Douglas-fir and 4 age classes of ponderosa pine were studied. Locations with different impacts (natal regeneration, planted thinned, planted) across the state of Oregon were sampled. Trees were felled and had the center of the internodes marked. Internodes were just distal to branch whorls at increasing number of nodes."
Leaf area,"Out of >250-600 trees (depending on the age class),  12 trees by age class were randomly selected for destructive sampling of leaf area.  Foliage attached to and distal to each segment was collected to determine leaf dry mass, and subsampled to determine leaf area/dry mass conversions (specific leaf area). Total leaf area was then calculated from the total dry mass and the specific leaf area. For the old-growth trees we kept 25% of the mass in all zones and for the saplings, intermediate and younger trees we saved 100% of the mass in all zones, but processed the samples identically to the old trees"

Height,"After the trees were felled,  total tree heights and base of the live crown heights were measured as the vertical distance from the ground."
Traits,"Specific leaf area: For Douglas-fir needles, the projected area of fresh foliage samples was determined using a video camera and NIH Image version 1.52 (public domain software). The projected area of each ponderosa pine needle was measured using a digital caliper, and assuming that all three needles of each fascicle represent a cylinder. The samples were then dried and weighed to establish the specific leaf area (SLA = the inverse of leaf mass per area) corresponding to fresh area to dry mass ratios."
