Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,A plot of 0.7 ha was established in a 0.5 y/o secondary forest at a minimal distance of 20 m from the edge of this forest stand (beyond this there was primary forest). Ten to 20 individuals (all had grown from seed) per species were selected such that bracketed the height range at which each ocured in the plot.
Leaf area, Digital photographs were taken of representative leaves and scanned for leaf area using the software Sigma Scan Pro 5. Leaves where then dried at 70oC for 5 days to obtain SLA.  
Stem cross sectional area,Calculated from diameter measurements at .3 and 1.3 m height
Height,Destructively : trees were cut at the base allowing direct height measurements
Crown area,Corwn diameter was measured visually in two directions
Biomass, Individuals were harvested and clipped into 25 cm sections. Stems, branches and foliage were put in separate bags and dried at 70oC for 5 days. 
Traits,Wood denisty: green volume by water disaplacement and then dry weight; Leaf angle using protactor; Leaf N; Tree LAI measured with a LI2000 content with Kjehldahl destruction
Growth environment,Light measurements using quantum sensors and realtive light distribution in the canopy calculated from the leaf area distribution measurred using the point method (i.e. raising a telescopic pole and counting leaf contacts)
