Topic, Description
Sampling strategy, "48 plots of 30m2 were created in the center of small (n=16) and big (n=16) gaps as well as in the nearby understory (n=16). Then a maximum of 5 seedlings of both species were harvested carrefully in the center, North, South, West and East part of the 30m2 plot."
Leaf area, "Leaf area was recorded using LI-3000 device from LiCOR while leaves were still fresh (i.e. right back from the field)."
Stem cross sectional area, "Stem diameter was recorded using a caliper at the colar and before seedling harvest."
Height, "Height was measured using a measuring tape before seedling harvest."
Crown area, "Crown width was measured as the mean of 2 perpendicular diameters."
Biomass, "Tree compartments were partitioned and dried at 70 deg C for several days until measured mass was constant."
Traits, "Crown height was measured as the lenght of the stem supporting alive branches or leaves. LMA was calculated from total leaf mass and total leaf area."
Growth environment, "Seedlings were naturally regenerated in the understory or in experimental gaps of small or big size. Light gradient was from 20% to 80% of total incoming PPFD."
