Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Study was conducted in a naturally regenerated secondary Pine forest (Block I in the Takadateyama National Forest, compartment 91-Ne, Na, and Tsu, 200 m a.s.l.). For Block III see Tadaki 1979. Three plots with size of 0.01 ha (10 m times 10 m) were set in the stand in 1951 (Ando et al. 1962). These plots were facing the south. The stand was treated to regenerate naturally during 1942 to 1947 and was estimated to be 8 years old in 1951. Plots were treated with different treatments in 1951-1952. Plot A  (sparse) was thinned to avoid strong competition. Plot B  (1000 trees/ha) was thinned to a density of 10,000 trees/ha in 1952. Plot C (control) was untreated. A total of 70 trees were cut down (20 from plot A, 20 from plot B, and 30 from plot C). Trees were selected randomly. Stems of sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0.0-0.2 m, 0.2-0.7m, and at interval of 0.5 m upward. Leaves and branches were separated."
Height,"Metadata not available."
Biomass,"Measured fresh mass of stem, branch, and leaves was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh weights (Ando et al. 1962). The ratio was estimated from subsamples dried at 80 degrees C."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara,  H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Ando et al. (1962). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara.Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
