Sampling strategy,"Three plots with size of 0.01 ha (10 m times 10 m) were set in a stand named "Block I" in 1951. These plots were facing the south. The stand was treated to regenerate naturally during 1942 to 1947 and was estimated to be 8 years old in 1951. Plots were treated with different treatments (sparse, 1000 trees/ha, control) in 1951-1952. Plot A was thinned to avoid strong competition. Plot B was thinned to a density of 1000 trees/ha in 1952. Plot C was control without thinning. A total of 70 trees were cut down (20 from plot A, 20 from plot B, and 30 from plot C). Stems of sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0.0-0.2 m, 0.2-0.7m, and at interval of 0.5 m upward. Leaves and branches were separated."

Stem cross sectional area," Not measured."
Height,"Metadata not available."
Crown area,"Not measured."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight of stem, branch, and leaves was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from subsamples dried at 80 degrees C."
Other variables," Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
