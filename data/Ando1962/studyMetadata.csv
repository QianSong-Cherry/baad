Sampling strategy,"Three plots with size of 0.01 ha (10 m times 10 m) were set in a stand named "Block I" in 1951 (Ando et al. 1962). These plots were facing the south. The stand was treated to regenerate naturally during 1942 to 1947 and was estimated to be 8 years old in 1951. Plots were treated with different treatments in 1951-1952. Plot A  (sparse)was thinned to avoid strong competition. Plot B  (1000 trees/ha) was thinned to a density of 1000 trees/ha in 1952. Plot C (control) was untreated. A total of 70 trees were cut down (20 from plot A, 20 from plot B, and 30 from plot C). Trees were selected randomly. Stems of sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0.0-0.2 m, 0.2-0.7m, and at interval of 0.5 m upward. Leaves and branches were separated."
Height,"Metadata not available."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight of stem, branch, and leaves was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights (Ando et al. 1962). The ratio was estimated from subsamples dried at 80 degrees C."
Other variables," Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
