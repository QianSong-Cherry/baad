Topic, Description
Sampling strategy, "After 4 years of treatment (opening and/or shading nets) 46 sugar maple and 44 yellow birch naturally regenerated were sampled in gaps and in the understory. 1 individual of each species was harvested in each gap excepted if the species was missing." 
Leaf area, "leaf area was measured on a subsample of leaves and total leaf mass was used to calculate total leaf area"
Stem cross sectional area, "Stem diameter at collar was measured using a caliper."
Height, "Height was measured using a measuring tape."
Crown area, "Crown width was calculated as the mean of 2 perpendicular diameters."
Biomass, "Tree compartments were partitioned and then dried to be weighted."
traits, "LMA was measured on cored disks taken from a well exposed leaf used for gas exchange measurments. Leaf nitrogen concentration was measured using an elemental NCS 2500 analyzer (ThermoQuest, "Milan, "Italy). Crown height was measured as the stem lenght supporting alive branches or leaves. Wood density was calculated as the force to displace a volume of water equivalent to stem section volume."
Growth environment, "Individuals are naturally regenerated individuals in gaps or in the understory. Shading nets were placed to suppress half of them during 4 years."
