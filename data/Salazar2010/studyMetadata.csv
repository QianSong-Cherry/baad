Topic, Description
"Sampling strategy", "Fourteen representative trees of different diameter classes were felled to establish their aboveground biomass: seven Fagus sylvatica trees and seven Pinus sylvestris trees. Each tree thud hsrvested was divided into trunk, branches and leaves."
"Leaf area", "Leaf area was measured on a subsample of leaves and total leaf mass was used to calculate total leaf area."
"Stem cross sectional area", "The DBH of all trees in 1 ha surface  on each experimental plot was measured."
"Height","The height of all trees in 1 ha surface was measured for each tree species using a measuring tape."
"Crown area"
"Biomass","Tree compartments (trunk, branches and leaves) were partitioned and then dried to be weighted. The trunks were separated into sections, according to their height (0-1.30 m, 1.30-3 m, 3-5 m, 5-7 m)."
"traits","Representative biomass and litter samples were ground for chemical analyses. Total carbon and nitrogen were determined using a Wosthoff carmograph and Macro-N Heraeus analyzer, respectively."
"Growth environment","Individuals are naturally regenerated individuals in gaps or in the understory. The Fagus sylvatica is a climacic species, whereas  Pinus sylvestris is a disclimacic species."
"Other variables",
"Year collected","2001-2005"
