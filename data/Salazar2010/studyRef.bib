  abstract = {Above-ground tree biomass and total amounts of nutrients in biomass were estimated at two plots: the first in a Castanea sativa Mill. paraclimax coppice and the second in a Quercus pyrenaica (Wild.) climax forest, both of them located in the south of the Salamanca (Spain), by harvesting 10 trees at each plot. In order to obtain the best fit possible, for these analyses, four regression equation...},
