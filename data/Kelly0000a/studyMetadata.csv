Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,Seedlings of two Eucalyptus species (Eucalytpus pilularis and Eucalyptus populnea) were grown under a treatment combination of ambient or elevated CO2 (380 or 700  ppm) and high or low water availability.  Measurements listed in file represent all digitized seedlings at ~8 months for E. pilularis and ~10.5 months for E. populnea.   
Leaf area,All leaves were digitized and leaf area was calculated as the sum of all individual leaves.
Stem cross sectional area,
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from the pot surface (stem base) to the highest apex.
Crown area,"Crown surface area was estimated from digitized points, assuming the crown was a convex hull.  "
