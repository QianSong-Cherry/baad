"Sampling strategy","One year old seedlings of Wollemi Pine were grown in a glasshouse at the University of Western Sydney for 17 months under 50% shadecloth.  Treatments imposed on the seedlings included a combination of temperature (26 or 31 degrees C) and CO2 (200, 400 or 640 ppm).  Treatments were continued for 17 months at which time a destructive harvest took place for 6 replicates from each temperature and CO2 combination.  "
"Leaf area","All leaves were measured in a leaf area meter (LI-COR 3100, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebr.).  "
"Height","Height was measured as the vertical distance from the pot surface to the highest apex."
"Biomass","All stems, leaves and roots were destructively harvested 80 days after planting, and dried for 1 week at 70degreesC."
"Growth environment","Glasshouse."
