	abstract = {A small watershed in the White Mountains of New Hampshire bearing mesophytic, cool-temperate, broadleaf-deciduous forests was studied. Acer saccharum, Betula lutea, and Fagus grandifolia are dominant, but toward higher elevations Picea rubens and Abies balsamea also occur and indicate the transition toward subalpine climate. The stands are young (following cutting in 1909-17) but contain older trees; stand composition is thought reasonably representative of the climax. For application of the Brookhaven system of forest dimension analysis, 93 sample trees of major species were cut and roots excavated. Mean dimensions of sample trees, and the constants for the system of logarithmic regressions relating volume, surface, mass, and growth to diameter at breast height and other independent variables, show decrease in tree sizes and height/diameter ratios toward higher elevations. Stand characteristics, based on application of the regressions to forest samples, show trends of decrease for the elevation belts from low to high: stem basal area 26.3, 23.7, and 22.0 m{\textasciicircum}2/ha, weighted mean tree height 16.9, 16.7, and 10.8 m, weighted mean age 124, 95, and 83 yr, stem wood volume 176, 155, and 103 m-3/ha, aboveground biomass (dry matter) 162, 152, and 102 t/ha, estimated volume increment 379, 365, and 223 cm3/m2/yr, aboveground net primary productivity (1956-60) 1127, 1041, and 790 g/m2/yr, and leaf area ratio 6.2, 5.7, and 5.5 m2/m2. Biomass (and, presumably, production) of root systems is 18%-21% of that aboveground. Different estimations suggest that a mean climax biomass for the watershed may be around 350 t/ha, aboveground. Net ecosystem production (i.e., addition to the pool of woody biomass in the community) is estimated as 350 g/m2/yr aboveground and 85 belowground for 1956-60, 238 and 52 g/m2/yr for 1961-65. Analysis of stem wood volume increments reveals an abrupt and striking (18%) decrease in volume growth and productivity from 1956-60 to 1961-65. The net primary productivity of the former period, with a weighted mean for the watershed of 1110 g/m2/yr above and below the ground, is thought more nearly normal for the forest. Both drought and effects of increasing air pollution (notably increasing acidity of rainfall) may be responsible for the recent decrease in productivity.},
