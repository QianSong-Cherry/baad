Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,Allometrics were developed for a range of species dominant in wet dry tropical savannas of the Northern Territory.
Leaf area,Leaf area was estimated by stripping all leaves from trees and determining dry weight. Leaves were dried at 65 degrees to constant weight.  Specific leaf area of a subsample was estimated and a dry weight conversion factor used to estimate total tree leaf area
Height,Tree height was measured with measuring tapes after the trees were felled
Biomass,After felling trees the stems were cut into I m section and freshweight determined.  From each section a 5 cm disk was cut and a dry weight freshweight ratio calculated so that total stem mass could be determined.  Branches were seperated into 3 size classes and the freshweight of each size class determined.  A subset from each size class was retained for estimated of the dry weight fresh weight ratio
