Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,"Allometrics were deevlop for a range of species dominat in wet dry tropical savannas of the northern territory."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was estimated by stripping all leaves from trees and dermining dry weight. Leaves were dried at 65 degrees to constant weight.  Specific leaf area of a subsampled was estimated and a dry weight conversion factor used to estimate total tree leaf area"
Height,"Tree hieght was measured with mesuring tapes after the trees were felled"
Biomass,"After felling trees the stems were cut into I m section and freshweight detmined.  From each section a 5 cm disk was cut and a dry weight freshweight ratio calculated so that total stem mass could be determined.  Branches were seperated into3 size classes andthe freshweight of each size class determined.  A subset from each size class was retained for estimated of the dry weight fresh weight ratio"
