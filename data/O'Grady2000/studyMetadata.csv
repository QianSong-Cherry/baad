Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,"Allometrics were developed for a range of species dominant in wet dry tropical savannas of the northern territory."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was estimated by stripping all leaves from the trees and determining dry weight. Leaves were dried at 65oC to constant weight.  Specific leaf area of a subsamples was estimated and a dry weight conversion factor was used to estimate total tree leaf area"
Height,"Tree hieght was measured with mesuring tapes after the trees were felled"
Biomass,"After felling trees the stems were cut into 1 m sections and fresh weight detmined.  From each section a 5 cm disk was cut and a dry weight:fresh weight ratio calculated so that total stem mass could be determined.  Branches were seperated into3 size classes and the fresh weight of each size class was determined. A subset from each size class was retained for estimation of the dry weight:fresh weight ratio"
