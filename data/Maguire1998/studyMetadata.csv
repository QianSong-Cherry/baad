"Topic","Description"
"Sampling strategy"," Sample trees were selected uniformly across the diameter range (11-48cm) and in association with nested permanent plots."
"Leaf area"," Determined from total leaf mass and leaf mass per area on subsampled foliage (see sections below)."
"Stem cross sectional area","From diameter at breast height to the nearest 0.1cm."
"Height","Total tree height to the nearest 0.1m."
"Crown area","Crown radius was measured in four cardinal directions."
"Biomass","For forty trees, a sample branch was collected. These sample branches were analyzed for dry weight, and leaf subsamples were collected for leaf area determination. For the 16 trees in this dataset, branch regressions were used to estimate total leaf mass from the 40 sample branches."
"Traits","Leaf mass per area was determined for a leaf subsample from the sample branches, sampled across the leaf age classes in approximate proportion to their representation on the whole branch. Leaf area was measured as projected area on 100 needles."
"Growth environment","The study site is part of a silvicultural experiment within the Penobscot Experimental Forest."
"Other variables","Sapwood area was determined on sample disks taken from all trees, by staining with methyl orange to determine sapwood/heartwood transition, and image analysis to measure the sapwood area."
