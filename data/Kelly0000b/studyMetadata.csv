Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,Seedlings of two Eucalyptus species (Eucalytpus pilularis and Eucalyptus populnea) were grown under a treatment combination of ambient or elevated CO2 (380 or 700  ?L L-1) and high or low water availability.  Measurements listed in file represent data from all seedlings at final harvest (~10 months for E. pilularis and ~12.5 months for E. populnea).   
Leaf area,"All leaves were measured in a leaf area meter (LI-COR 3100, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebr.).  "
Stem cross sectional area,
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from the pot surface to the highest apex.
Crown area,
Biomass,"Stems, leaves and roots were destructively harvested at end of experiment (~10 months after planting for Eucalyptus pilularis and ~12.5 months for Eucalyptus populnea), and dried for 1 week at 70degreesC."
