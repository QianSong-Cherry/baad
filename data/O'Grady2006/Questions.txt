How would you reclassify your below ground mass categories (5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20+stump) within the following: 1. fine root mass 2. coarse root mass?

Should the height of seedling 16 in plot 1 harvested on Dec-02 be 34cm rather than 3.4cm?

Can you please check biomass data from zulu plot, these seem to be in different units to other measurements and have thus been excluded until we can verify this.
