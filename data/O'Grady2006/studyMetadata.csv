Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,"Data are for rainfed and irrigated trees.  Trees were a monospecific stand of eucalyptus globulus grown at a spacing of 3X3 meters.  All allometric relatioships were developed from above and below ground hravests."
Leaf area,"Leaf area samples were taken from each of three zones within the canopy, upper, mid and lower.  A ub sample sample of leaves from each zone was used to determine specifca leaf area.  Leaf of of the zone was calculated as the product of specific leaf area and leaf dry eight for each zone. "
Height,"Heights were measured monthly using height poles.  At the time of harvets height to the growing tip was checked using a tape measure"
Biomass,"Each tree was subdivided into it components, of stem, branches, leaf area, fine roots and coarse roots.  All merial was dried to constant weight in a drying room at 30 degrees.  Subsamples of each samle were dried at65 degrees to constant weight, and a dry weight conversion factor used to estimate the total dry weight at 65 degrees"
