Sampling strategy,"Data are for rainfed and irrigated trees.  Trees were a monospecific stand of eucalyptus globulus grown at a spacing of 3X3 meters.  All allometric relatioships were developed from above and below ground hravests."
Leaf area,"Leaf area samples were taken from each of three zones within the canopy, upper, mid and lower.  A subsample of leaves from each zone was used to determine specifca leaf area. Leaf area of the zone was calculated as the product of specific leaf area and leaf dry weight for each zone. "
Height,"Heights were measured monthly using height poles.  At the time of harvest, height to the growing tip was checked using a tape measure"
Biomass,"Each tree was subdivided into it components, of stem, branches, leaf area, fine roots and coarse roots.  All material was dried to constant weight in a drying room at 30oC.  Subsamples of each sample were dried at 65oC to constant weight, and a dry weight conversion factor was used to estimate the total dry weight"
