Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Trees were sampled in the southern Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (35°N, 83°W) as well as in an area 4 km to the south; both areas are on the Nantahala National Forest. All trees were selected from mature stands (i.e., >80 years old). Trees used in this study were selected by species, size, and location and were harvested between June and August. The range of species and sizes was selected to represent the distribution observed in over 400 permanent plots across the Coweeta Basin. Trees were selected using a stratified random design so that sample trees would represent a wide diameter range. In total, 87 individuals spanning a dbh of 3.8 to 63 cm were selected."
Leaf area,"The crown was divided into 3 sections. Within each section, we selected 10 representative leaves from each of the canopy section subsamples and separated the petioles from the leaf blades. The total area of the leaf blades was measured using a leaf area meter (LI-COR 3100, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebr.); the blades and petioles were dried (65degC) and weighed to determine SLA and the ratio of leaf blade mass to total leaf mass."
Stem cross sectional area," Diameter of stems were measured at breast height (1.37 m). 4 cm disks were cut at base, at DBH and at crown base to determine the sapwood/heartwood area using potassium iodide to determine sapwood/heartwood boundaries."
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground to the highest apex and crown base.
Crown area,Crown width was measured at right angles including the widest width. Projected area and volume were estimated by assuming an ellipse/ellipsoid.
Biomass,Stems were divided into 1- or 2-m sections and weighed fresh. The crown was divided into thirds. Branches from each third were weighed separately and a sample branch from each third was collected for foliage mass ratio measurements. 4 cm disks were cut from the base of each log section for determination of water content as well as the bark/wood mass ratio. Samples were then dried to a constant mass at 65degC and weighed to determine moisture content.
Traits,"The ratio of leaf blade mass to total leaf mass was used to compute leaf mass per area for each crown third. Nitrogen concentration was measured on 50 leaves from each crown subsample. Branch nitrogen concentration was determined on a representative branch from each crown position subsample. For stem tissue nitrogen analysis, bark, sapwood and a 10° wedge from the remaining wood were sampled from the stem disks."
Growth environment,"Field, wild."
