Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted in the University Forests in Chiba, the University of Tokyo (Suzuki et al. 1990). Twenty trees were felled in Zelkova serrata plantations at Koyanosawa (31 years old) on August 22-24, 1988 and at Ninosawa (65 years old) on August 30-31, 1988. The sample trees were cut at ground level then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, at intervals of 2 m upward."
Leaf area,"Individual leaf areas of ca. 20 leaves were measured for each layer by an automatic planimeter (Planimex 25, Nireco) before oven-dried at 85 degree C and weighted (Suzuki et al. 1990). Total leaf area for each layer was estimated from the total dry mass of leaves and the obtained leaf area/leaf mass ratios."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured by measuring tape after the trees were felled."
Biomass,"Fresh mass of stem, branches, and leaves in each layer were measured (Suzuki et al. 1990). Woody parts with diameter smaller than 7 cm were classified as branches. Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. To obtain the ratio of branch and leaves, subsamples were taken for each layer. For the ratio of stem, a disk was taken from each layer. Subsamples were weighted for fresh mass, oven-dried at 85 degree C, and weighted for dry mass."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
