"Sampling strategy"," In permanent plots, diameter at breast height was measured in all trees to obtain diametric amplitude in each treatment. The trees of each treatment were then divided into three equal amplitude classes, representing the intermediate, codominant and dominant crown classes. For each treatment and crown classes, three trees were selected randomly. This gives nine trees per treatment, making a total of 36 trees in the entire sample."
"Leaf area"," Leaf area was determined with a Li-Cor 3100 measuring device, using a subsample of 12 needles which were subsequently dried at 100oC for 24 hours and weighed with a precision of 0.01 g. The sum of the sections constitutes the leaf area of the tree (projected leaf area)."
"Stem cross sectional area"," Disks of 2 to 3 cm of width at diameter at breast height (Dbh), and after that every 3.5 m, include a disk at the base of the live crown. The disks were photographed with a digital camera in the laboratory. Each disk was placed on an aluminum platform, where the digital camera was mounted. Measurements of hertwood and total area were made using digital photographs and georeferred using Arcinfo 7.2 NT software. This allowed to estimate the sapwood area at Dbh level by difference."
"Height"," Felling trees were measured directely using instrument."
"Crown area"," Before felling crown projection in all four cardinal direction  were measured. Crown areas were estimated assuming a conic shape of the crowns with a height H and a radius equal to the mean crown radius where the crown was widest."
"Biomass"," Dry mass of the crown was estimated from the proportions of dry mass of each crown component and the total green mass of each section measured of the crown in the field. Wood and bark biomass as the product between the volume and anhydride density. Root biomass as the product of the potentially available areas for root mass and soil area samples. The sum of all trees components gives the dry mass of the tree."
"Traits"," Silvopastoral in cluster and bands and 185 trees/ha. Forestry plantations at 490 trees/ha."
"Growth environment"," Field experimental."
"Other variables"," Prairies"
"Year collected","2002"
