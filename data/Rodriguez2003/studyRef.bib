	abstract = {The effect of silvicultural regime, tree size and competitive status on needle mass, root fine production and allocation of carbon to stem wood was analyzed. Three stands with different agroforestry treatments were compared with one managed traditionally. Data were obtained through destructive sampling of 36 trees and analyzed by {ANOVA} and regression analysis. The analysis allowed us to conclude that foliage mass was not affected by the silvicultural treatment, tree size or competitive status. Fine root biomass showed an inverse relationship with fertilization. Growth efficiency was not affected by the management treatment, tree size, or intraspecific competition. The greater stem wood allocation recorded in the agroforestry treatment than in the forestry regime, is interpreted as a response to two different types of competition. Competition for light appears to induce growth in height and diameter as a function of local environment conditions. Competition for nutrients appears to reduce allocation to fine roots and increase allocation to stem wood.},
