"Topic","Description"
"Sampling strategy","Seedlings were excavated at the onset of the dry season (April-May) to evaluate seedling morphology just before they were exposed to drought for the first time."
"Leaf area","The number of leaves was counted and leaves were digitized with a desktop-scanner (Canon Lide 30). Total leaf area was determined with the help of pixel-counting software (Van Berloo 1998)."
"Stem cross sectional area","Diameters were recorded at the base and the top of the stem."
"Height","Height measured from the base of the stem just above the root to the top of the stem just under the growth meristem."
"Biomass","Seedlings were dissected into roots, stems, leaves weighed and then oven-dried for 48 h at 65degC and measured again for their dry mass."
"Traits","Stem diameters at the base and top of the stem were used to calculate stem volume, which in turn together with stem mass generated an averaged stem density."
"Year collected","2006"
