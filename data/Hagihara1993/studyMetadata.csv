Sampling strategy,"The allometric relationships between different dimensions of a hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa (Sieb. Et Zucc.) Endl.) tree were examined on the basis of 55 destructive samples, which were collected from four different stands and whose age ranged from 12 to 59 years.  Only 24 sample trees are reported here. For the rest of 31 trees see Iijima1991, Mori1991, Nakagaki1983, Tanao1982, and Yamaji1991. Biomass and leaf area estimates were determined by the stratified clip technique, in which the stratum was 0.0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-2.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward."
Leaf area,"Leaf area was determined with area meters (Murayama NCE-3, Hayashi AAC-100) on subsamles and was then extrapolatied to total leaf area using specific leaf area from each stratum and summing up each stratum.  Specific leaf area was estimated from a sample of leaves used for estimating the ratio of dry/fresh weight and area. Total leaf weight was measured for each stratum."
Stem cross sectional area,"Stem volume (dm3) was based on stem diameters at both ends of the strata (i.e., stem diameter at strata of 0-0.3 m and at final 1 m strata at top of tree)."
Height,"Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground surface to the highest apex of each tree."
Biomass,"Trees were separated into roots, stems, branches and leaves, and then weighed. Sub-samples of the total fresh weight were taken and dried in ventilated ovens at 85 degC for a few days for fresh mass/dry mass estimates. The fresh biomass was converted into dry biomass estimates of roots, stem, branches and leaves per tree using the respective dry/fresh mass ratios."
Growth environment,"Plantation managed."
