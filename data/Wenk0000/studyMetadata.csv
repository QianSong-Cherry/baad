"Topic","Description"
"Sampling strategy","Individuals were sampled across sites of known time since last fire. At each site we chose healthy growing individuals."
"Height","Measured from base of plant to apex"
"Biomass","Plants were harvested, dried and weighed."
"Leaf area","Caluclated from using an estimate of LMA and measured leaf biomass."
"Traits", "LMA was calculated on samples taken from top, middle and base of  plants growing nearby and similar-to those used for biomass measures. LMA was estimated by scanning fresh leaves then weighing and measuring dry mass."
"Growth environment","Harvested in the field in semi-open conditions"
