Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,Five individuals of 21.3 - 40.7 m in height were selected in the forest.
Leaf area,"Leaf litter was collected systematically, and dry mass was recorded. Length, width, and dry mass of individual leaves from the dried leaf litter were measured. Fresh harvested leaves were scanned for leaf area using an area meter (AAM-8, Hayashi denko, Tokyo, Japan) and leaf area of the leaves from the leaf litter was estimated using the relationship between area, lenght and width."
Stem cross sectional area,Diameter at breast height was measured.
Height,"Overall tree heights and lowest leaf heights were calculated using angle-distance measurements to the top of the tree and to the 1.5 m rod using a clinometer (Blume Leiss, Carl Leiss, Berlin). "
Crown area,Crown widths were measured at the widest part of the crown and perpendicular to it. The projected area of the crown was calculated as an ellipse based on these two measurements.
Biomass,Standing leaf biomass was calculated by annual leaf litter biomass and mean leaf lifespan for each tree.
Growth environment,In the natural forest.
"Year collected","1997-1999"
