Sampling strategy,"In the autumn of 1999, 2000, and 2001, 46 trees larger or equal to 3 cm in DBH were harvested in a forest adjacent to the Yamashiro Experimental Forest (Goto et al. 2003). After measuring stem diameter at 0.3 m and 1.3 m above ground, each tree was cut down and separated into stem and branches. Stems were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward. Fresh weight of each stem section was measured and subsample was taken to obtain the ratio of dry to fresh weight. Branches were separated into large, medium, small branches, and twigs with leaves and weighted. Subsamples were taken to obtain the ratio of dry to fresh weight. Subsample for twigs with leaves were further separated into current-year leaves, older leaves, current-year branches, older branches, and flowers and fruits, and weighted to obtain the ratio of each component to the total. Fresh weight of each component was obtained from the ratio and the total fresh weight of twigs with leaves. Additionally, 20 trees with DBH larger than or equal to 1 cm and smaller than 3 cm were harvested. After cutting down, DBH and tree height were measured. Fresh weight of stem, branch, current-year leaves, and older leaves were measured. Subsamples were taken for leaves and their areas were measured. For 16 trees, roots were excavated carefully (Dannoura et al. 2006)."
Leaf area,"Projected leaf area of subsample were measured before oven drying and total leaf area per tree was estimated from SLA and leaf biomass (Goto et al. 2003)."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Tree height and height to the lowest living branch were measured after trees were cut down (Goto et al. 2003)."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weights of stem, branch, and leaves were converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights (Goto et al. 2003). The ratio was estimated from subsamples which were oven-dried at 95 degrees C. Root dry weight were measured after oven-dried at 95 degrees C for 48 hours (Dannoura et al. 2006)."
Other variables,"Root biomass data was reported in Dannoura et al. (2006) and merged to this data by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
