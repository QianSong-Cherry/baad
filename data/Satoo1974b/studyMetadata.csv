Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted in three Betula maximowicziana secondary forests (48 years old, 300-350 m a.s.l.) regenerated after a large forest fire in 1911 located in the University of Tokyo Hokkaido Forest. Sampling plot of size 20 m times 50 m were created on the upper, middle, and lowere parts of the slope (I, II, and III). Details of the sampling plots are listed in Table 1 of Satoo  (1974a). Five sample trees were selected from each plot that were of average size and cut down at ground level  in the summer of 1958. Sample trees were divided into stem, branches, and leaves. Stem and braches were futher separated into layers at the height of 0, 0.3, 1.3 m and the interval of 2 m upward."
Leaf area,"Total leaf area was estimated from the fresh mass and the ratio of leaf area to fresh mass which was obtained from subsamples. Leaf area was measured by the dot-counting method (Negishi et al. 1957 J. Jp. For. Soc. 39: 380-384).  Transpalent plate with marked dots at a certian interval such as every 1 cm was placed randomly on a leaf and estimate leaf area from the relationship between leaf area and the counted number of dots in the leaf."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Method not reported."
Biomass,"Stem  biomass was estimated by multiplying its volume with bulk density both determined from subsamples.  Stem subsamples were taken at the height of 0, 0.3, 1.3 m and the interval of 2 m upward. Using the stem analysis techinque, stem volume was estimated. Branch and leaf biomass were estimated from fresh mass and the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was obtained from subsamples. Branch diameter was measured for all branches at 10 cm from their base. Branch subsample was taken at 0.5-2 m from the base of the branch for a branch having mean branch diameter in each layer. Leaf subsample were taken."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Satoo (1974a). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
