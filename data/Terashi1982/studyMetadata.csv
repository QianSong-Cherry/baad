"Sampling strategy","Ten trees were felled in each of two Castanopsis sieboldii secondary forests in Amami-oshima, Japan in December 1980. Stand A regenerated after clear cutting before 1945 and assumed to be 45 years old (300 m a.s.l., south-east facing slope). Stand B regenerated from sprouts after clear cutting in 1964 and assumed to be 16 years old (ca. 200 m a.s.l., south-east facing gentle slope). Trees were selected to cover size ranges. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers and components (stem, branches, and leaves)."
"Leaf area","Leaf area was probably estimated from leaf mass and the ratio of leaf area to mass. Leaf area was measured by automatic leaf area meter."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Method not reported."
"Biomass","Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples. "
"Other variables","M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Terashi and Setoguchi (1982). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
