Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"The study was conducted in natural forests at the Teshio Experimental Forest, Hokkaido University (Takagi et al. 2010). Seven or eight trees per species were selected to cover wide range of diameter at breast height (DBH) in late August of 2001 through 2007."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"The trunk top heights were measured after cutting the trees (Takagi et al. 2010)."
Crown area,"The crown widths for the two directions (north to south, east to west) were measured before cutting each tree (Takagi et al. 2010)."
Biomass,"The fresh mass of each organ (trunk, branches, and leaves) was weighed at 2-m height intervals along the trunk of each sampled tree (Takagi et al. 2010). The trunk was defined as the part that directly connects with roots and reaches the top of the tree, and the remaining woody aboveground parts were categorized as branches. The heights of branches and leaves were categorized based on the actual position in the stand, not by the height connecting with the trunk. Branches were divided into three categories based on diameter (<2 cm, 2-5 cm, and >5 cm), and the fresh mass was measured for each category at 2-m height intervals. For Betula and Quercus, all leaves were separated from the trunks and branches and the fresh mass was measured. For Abies, all leaves were separated from the trunk and branches when these woody parts were more than 2 cm in diameter. For those branches less than 2 cm in diameter, subsample of the branches with leaves (>1.5 kg fresh mass) was separated into leaves and branches at 2-m height intervals, and the leaf/branch dry mass ratio was applied to all the branches with leaves to estimate each leaf and branch dry mass for each height. For an Abies tree with a 50.16-cm DBH, the leaf/branch dry mass ratio ranged 0.430-0.468, and the average and standard deviation of the 10 height categories (21.35 m in the tree height) were 0.446 and 0.011, respectively. Even if we assume that the deviation in the ratio among the height categories was caused only by the sampling error, this leaf dry mass estimation procedure causes < +/- 2% error (or +/- 1.9 of 117 kg dry leaf mass) for this tree. Stumps with roots were pulled out using a backhoe, and the remaining roots were dug up manually using shovels. The soil on roots was completely washed away by spraying river water on site with a compressor and using brushes. Roots were split into four categories based on diameter (< 2 cm, 2-5 cm, 5-10 cm, and >10 cm), and the fresh mass was measured for each category. Fine roots (< ca.0.5 cm in diameter) were not collected. A disk of ca. 3 cm thick was taken from each 2-m interval of trunk of a sampled tree, and the fresh mass was measured. Each disk was oven-dried at 70-80˚C until there was no change in the mass (typically it took 1 month), and the dry mass was measured. The trunk dry mass was then estimated at each 2-m interval by multiplying its fresh mass by the dry/fresh mass ratio of the disk sample. For branches, coarse roots, and leaves, typically 1-3 kg of the fresh subsample was weighed for each 2-m height interval and each branch and coarse-root diameter class and oven-dried at 70-80˚C until there was no change in the mass. The dry mass was estimated by multiplying the fresh mass by the dry/fresh mass ratio of the sample for each diameter (branches and coarse roots) and height classes."
