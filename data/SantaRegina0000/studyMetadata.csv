Topic, Description
Sampling strategy, "Eleven Castanea sativa and Quercus pyrenaica trees representative of different diameter at breast height (DBH) classes were felled to establish their aboveground biomass. Each tree harvested was divided into trunk, branch and leaves."
Leaf area, "Leaf area was measured on a subsample of leaves and total leaf mass was used to calculate total leaf area."
Stem cross sectional area,"The DBH of all trees in 1 ha surface  on each experimental plot was measured."  
Height,"The height of all trees in 1 ha surface was measured for each tree species using a measuring tape."
Crown area,
Biomass,"The trunks were separated into sections, according to their height (from 0-1.30, 1.30-3, 3-5, 5-7 m, and so on) and weighed. The wood was separated from the leaves. Sub-samples were brought to the laboratory for further analyses; moisture content was measured after drying to constant weight at 80oC."
traits,"Representative biomass and litter samples were ground for chemical analyses. Total carbon and nitrogen were determined using a Wosthoff carmograph and Macro-N Heraeus analyzer, respectively."
Growth environment,"Individuals are naturally regenerated individuals in gaps or in the understory. The Fagus sylvatica is a climacic species, whereas  Pinus sylvestris is a disclimacic species."
