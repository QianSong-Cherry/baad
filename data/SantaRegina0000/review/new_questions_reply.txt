Questions about the study:  SantaRegina0000

1. In your former reply you indicated that your Metadata file was OK but in fact it is still missing the item SAMPLING STRATEGY. Could you please provide it below?
Eleven Castanea sativa and Quercus pyrenaica trees representative of different diameter at breast height (DBH) classes were felled to establish their aboveground biomass. Each tree harvested was divided into trunk, branch and leaves. The trunks were separated into sections, according to their height (from 0–1.30, 1.30–3, 3–5, 5–7 m, and so on) and weighed. The wood was separated from the leaves. Sub-samples were brought to the laboratory for further analyses; moisture content was measured after drying to constant weight at 80 °C.

2. What was the main vegetation type of your study? Please answer using one of the following categories: Sav = Savannah; TropRF = Tropical rainforest; TempRF = temperate rainforest; TropSF = Tropical seasonal forest; TempF = Temp forest; BorF = Boreal forest; Wo = Woodland; Gr = Grassland; Sh = Shrubland; De = Desert
Castanea sativa: Wo = Woodland
Quercus pyrenaica: Wo = Woodland

3. Could you please indicate the taxonomic family of each of your studies species?
Castanea sativa species is a Fagaceae, or beech family
Quercus pyrenaica species is a Fagaceae, or beech family

4. What about the functional type of each species? Please answer using one of the following categories: EA = evergreen angiosperm; DA = deciduous angiosperm; EG = evergreen gymnosperm; DG = deciduous gymnosperm
Castanea sativa: DA = deciduous angiosperm
Quercus pyrenaica: DA = deciduous angiosperm

5. Could you please indicate the status (in terms of shading) of your sampled stands? Please answer using one of the following categories: 0 = supressed, 1 = intermediate, 2 = codominant (crown partly exposed), 3 = dominant (crown fully exposed)
Castanea sativa: 2 = codominant (crown partly exposed)
Quercus pyrenaica: 2 = codominant (crown partly exposed)

6. What is the name of the sampled location? For example: "Parque Nacional ...." La Honfría" in Linares de Riofrío, Salamanca, Spain
