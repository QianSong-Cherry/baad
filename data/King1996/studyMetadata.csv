Topic,Description,
Sampling strategy,"Fourteen tree species found at La Selva Biological Station were sampled to determine allometric relationships between crown dimensions, tree height and diameter.  Measurements included total height of individual trees, diameter at 1/10 of tree height and the minimum and maximum leaf height.    ",
Leaf area,,
Stem cross sectional area,Stem diameter was measured at 1/10 the height of each individual tree.  ,
Height,Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground surface to the highest apex of each tree.  ,
Crown area,"Crown width was projected from the ground level in two different directions, including the widest projection.",
