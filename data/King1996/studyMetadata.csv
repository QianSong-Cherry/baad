Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,
Stem cross sectional area,"Diameters of all trees <8 cm were measured in two perpendicular directions using calipers and averaged. Diameters of larger trees were calculated from their circumferences. X pi/4 yields the cross section areas. Diameters were measured at 1/10th of tree height, except for large buttressed trees for which diameter was measured above the buttress."
Height,Height from stem base to the centre of the highest leaf and from stem base to the lowest leaf.
Crown area,Width in two perpendicular directions x pi/4.
Growth environment,Understory or gaps in tropical forests. Nearly all trees were in old-growth tropical forest.
"Year collected","1988-1990"
