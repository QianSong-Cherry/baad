Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,
Stem cross sectional area,"Diameters of all trees <8 cm were measured in two perpendicular directions using calipers and averaged. Diameters of larger trees were calculated from their circumferences. X pi/4 yields the crossection areas, which were used only to calculate stem volumes."
Height,Height from stem base to the centre of the heighest leaf and from stem base to the lowest leaf.
Crown area,Width in two perpendicular directions x pi/4/.
Growth environment,Understory or gaps in tropical forests. Nearly all trees were in old-growth tropcal forest.
