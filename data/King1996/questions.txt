You actually provided us with scanned data sheets for this study, but we have now had the data transcribed. We were able to interpret most of the variables, but wonder if we have made a mistake for the variable "lowest leaf" for the following species: Anaxagorea crassipetala, Dipteryx panamensis. In those species, the measure for lowest leaf is lower than the average leaf height. Is it possible that for those species you measured crown depth, whereas you measured height of lowest leaf for other species?
