Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sample trees were selected to represent each diameter class or all trees within a plot were felled (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1963). Usuda National Forest and Ueda National Forest were surveyed on 25 July to 13 August, 1961. Sumitomo Forestry Co. Forest was surveyed on 23 October to 1 November, 1961. Naeba was surveyed in September 1961. Sample trees were felled at the base, and diameter at breast height, tree height, height of lowest living branch, and length of longest branch were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, 1.3-2.3 m, and at intervals of 1 m upward. Fresh weight of stem, branches, and leaves in each layer were measured. For conifer species, branches and leaves were separated into layers according to the height of whorl branch which branches and leaves are attached. Chiba Forest of Tokyo University was surveyed on 27 November to 2 December 1961 for aboveground and 13-15 December 1961 for root. Trees in this stand were 12-15 years old and regenerated naturally on a land formally used as forest tree nursery. Sample trees were cut into layers based on stem age. Branches and leaves within each layer were further separated based on their ages (current-year, one year, etc.). Only main roots were excavated and weighted."
Leaf area, "Leaf area was estimated for broadleaf species from fresh weight and leaf area per fresh weight which were obtained from subsample (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1963)."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured after sample trees were cut down (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1963)."
Biomass,"Measured fresh weight was converted to dry weight from the ratio of dry to fresh weights. The ratio was estimated from subsamples (Forestry Laboratories of Kyoto University, Tokyo University, Niigata University, and Shinshu University 1963)."
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
