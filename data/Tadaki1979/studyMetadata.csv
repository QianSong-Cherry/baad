Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sutdy was conducted in a naturally regenerated secondary Pine forest (Block III in the Takadateyama National Forest, compartment 91-Ka, Wo, and Wa, 200 m a.s.l.). The forest regenerated naturally during 1942-1947. Experimental plots were created in 1951. Plot A was thinned in 1961 to avoid strong competition (2100 trees / ha). Plot B was thinned in 1951 to the density of 10,000 trees / ha. Plot C was control without any thinning. The shape of a plot was 10 m times 10 m quadrate.    Eight sample trees were selected from each plot to represent various diameter classes and felled in January 1976.  Sample trees were treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 1 m depth and separated into stem, branches, current-year branches, old needles, and new needles."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Not reported."
Biomass,"Measured fresh mass was converted to dry mass from the ratio of dry to fresh mass. The ratio was estimated from subsamples."
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Tadaki et al. (1979). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
