Area of of sapwood, heartwood cross section and total stem cross section
Disks cut at breast height (1.30 m ) were used for area analysis using sulphanilic acid and sodium nitrite to visually determine the sapwood/heartwood boundary. The width of the sapwood was calculated from the average of four measurements at right angles.
