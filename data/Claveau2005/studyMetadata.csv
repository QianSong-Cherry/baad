"Sampling strategy","Three study sites in British Columbia and six in Quebec were selected (Table 1). They were selected to ensure that trees of each species could be sampled across a full light gradient (Fig. 1). For each species, care was taken to select stands within the same soil drainage and soil texture classes. Stands with multicanopied structure were preferred, because they offered better opportunities for finding a range of sample tree heights across light gradients. Areas disturbed within the last 10 years (e.g., harvesting, blowdown, insect related attack) were avoided. Study trees were sampled along 5 m wide transects established along gradients of stand density."
"Age","Tree age was estimated from a disk at ground level by counting the number of rings."
"Leaf area of whole plant","Leaf area was estimated using the specific needle area and weight mass of each needle age class"
"Area of sapwood cross section at base","Sapwood area was estimated from a disk sawn at the base of the seedling. Sapwood area was located using a backlight and then drawn on the disk . The surface of the shaded area was measured using the image analysis software NIH Image"
"Total height","Stem length from ground level to the tip of the leader"
"Diameter of stem at base","Diameter of the stem above the root swell. This diameter was measured using a caliper."
"Leaf mass","Mass of all needles. Needles were were dried in a forced-air oven for 48 h at 70 C. Abies trees taller than 1 m were sub-sampled. Branches were first sorted into groups of both similar length and comparable ratios of foliage versus wood mass (visual estimation). One branch from each group was processed. Each group of the remaining branches was weighed to determine fresh mass. To determine dry mass, ratios of ovendried mass to fresh mass of the processed branch from each group of branches were calculated and applied to the corresponding group. To determine the total dry mass of needle and branches of each tree, the estimated masses were summed."
"Mass of all stem tissue","Mass of stem and branches.  They were dried in a forced-air oven for 48 h at 70 C, whereas bigger stems were dried at 70 C for 7 days. Abies trees taller than 1 m were sub-sampled. Branches were first sorted into groups of both similar length and comparable ratios of foliage versus wood mass (visual estimation). One branch from each group was processed. Each group of the remaining branches was weighed to determine fresh mass. To determine dry mass, ratios of ovendried mass to fresh mass of the processed branch from each group of branches were calculated and applied to the corresponding group. To determine the total dry mass of needle and branches of each tree, the estimated masses were summed."
"Mass of all above-ground structures","See Leaf mass and Mass of all stem tissue."
"Branch mass","Branches were dried in a forced-air oven for 48 h at 70 C. Abies trees taller than 1 m were sub-sampled. Branches were first sorted into groups of both similar length and comparable ratios of foliage versus wood mass (visual estimation). One branch from each group was processed. Each group of the remaining branches was weighed to determine fresh mass. To determine dry mass, ratios of ovendried mass to fresh mass of the processed branch from each group of branches were calculated and applied to the corresponding group. To determine the total dry mass of needle and branches of each tree, the estimated masses were summed."
"Leaf mass per area","m.lf/a.lf"
"Growth environment","Field, wild."
"Other variables","Saplings grown under closed canopy and canopy openness were measured using hemispherical photographs"
