Topic, Description
Sampling strategy,"Eighteen sample trees were felled and measured in August 1999.  Trees in sample plots were classified as dominant and nondominant on the basis of crown size and position in canopy. The trees in each plot and each class were ordered by basal area, the cumulative basal area of the ordered series was divided into three equal classes and one sample tree was picked randomly from each third except in the dense plot where two nondominant sample trees were picked from each three classes. This yielded three, six, and nine sample trees from the sparse, medium, and dense plot, respectively, and included nine dominant and nine nondominant trees."
Leaf area,Leaf area estimate was based on leaf biomass (see below) and specific leaf area. SLA (projected) was measured on sample leaves  (12.5 m2/kg). 
Stem cross sectional area,Stem cross sectional area was determined from sample disks taken at breast height (1.3 m) and at crown base. The cross section was calculated as a circle with radius equalling the average of the largest diameter and that perpendicular to it. 
Height,Height was measured using a tape measure on the felled trees. Breast height was recorded before felling and the part of the stem above breast height was added to 1.3 m to obtain the total height.
Crown area,"Before felling, the width of the crown was measured at the widest diameter and the one perpendicular to that. Crown area can be approximated using this and crown length, measured using a tape measure after felling."
Biomass,"Branches were sampled systematically from each tenth of the crown length and discs were taken from the stem at a number of heights, all including breast height and crown base. Stand-wise regression model were developed for the sample branches to estimate leaf and branch dry mass from branch diameter and distance from the tree top, which were measured from all live branches in the crown. Stem volume was calculated from the logs between the disc measurement heights by assuming the logs as cut cones. The volume was converted to stem biomass using wood density of the lower disc of each log, obtained by weighing and immersion of the disc."

Growth environment,"Effective Temperature Sum 1215 degree-days (5 °C threshold), MAT = 2.2 °C, MAP = 640 mm. Soil type = stonefree silt. Stands consisted of three experimental plots of silver birch with sparse, medium, and dense stocking, were planted in the spring of 1971 on an abandoned field at densities 400, 1600, and 5000 ha–1.  No harvests had been carried out prior to the measurements carried out in 1999."
