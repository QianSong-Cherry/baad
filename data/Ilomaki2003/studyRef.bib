	abstract = {This study tests the hypothesis that the aboveground structure of silver birch (Betula pendula L.) is derivable from crown rise across a range of social positions of trees. Data were measured in 30-year-old birch monocultures of three different initial spacings. As suggested by the pipe model, there was a strong linear correlation between the total cross-sectional area of branches and that of stem at crown base. Foliage mass correlated with stem basal area at crown base. An allometric relationship was found between foliage mass and crown length, and the mean length (weighted by basal area) of branches correlated linearly with crown length. Pipe ratios of branches and foliage were found to be independent of slenderness (= tree height / breast height diameter). The proportion of stem in aboveground biomass increased from 80% to 96% when the slenderness index increased, the proportions of branches and leaves decreasing, respectively. For crown biomass, the proportion of foliage was greater in the more slender stems, accompanied with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of stems, while the share of branches remained rather constant. The ratio of productive (foliage) and nonproductive (stem plus branches) biomass inside the crown was positively correlated with slenderness, but in the whole tree, the ratio declined with increasing slenderness. The results of this study support the theory of functional balance and seem to be in conflict with the priority principle of allocation.},
