\underline{Species}: Dipterocarpus globosus, Dipterocarpus tempehes, Dryobalanops aromatica, Dryobalanops lanceolata, Hopea bracteata, Hopea sphaerocarpa, Shorea beccariana, Shorea crassa, Shorea falciferoides ssp. glaucescens, Shorea laxa, Shorea macroptera ssp. baillonii.

\underline{Sampling strategy}: 187 individuals measured. 

\underline{Leaf area}: Individual and total leaf area was measured using the software LIA32 for Windows 95 (ver. 0.371b1, K. Yamamoto).

\underline{Stem cross sectional area}:

\underline{Height}: Total height was measured on each individual. Heights ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 m.

\underline{Crown area}:

\underline{Biomass}: Total leaf mass, Stem mass, Branch mass and Total root mass
Sampled saplings were divided into four parts: roots, main trunk, branches and leaf lamina. All parts were dried to constant weight and dried.

\underline{Traits}:

\underline{Growth environment}: Field experimental.

\underline{Other variables}:
