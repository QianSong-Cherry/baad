"Sampling strategy"," All dipterocarp species for which enough saplings of a comparable size could be collected and which were not focused in Aiba & Nakashizuka 2005, were analysed. In November 2003, 20 - 30 sound saplings of various sizes (0.1 - 1.5m tall) of each species were sampled to determine their allometric relationships. All sampled individuals grew under closed canopies."
"Leaf area"," For each sapling, the total leaf area and maximum individual leaf area were measured using the software LIA32 for Windows 95 (K. Yamamoto) after scanning the images."
"Stem cross sectional area"," Stem diameter was measured at ground using calliper at right angles."
"Height"," Height was measured as the vertical distance from the ground to the highest apex."
"Crown area"," Crown width was measured at right angles including the widest width. Projected area was estimated by assuming an ellipse."
"Biomass"," Saplings were divided into root, stem, branches and leaf lamina. Each compartment was dried to constant weight and weighed. Leaf petioles were not included in Total leaf mass. All parts of the saplings were weighed after being oven-dried at 60degC for at least 5 d."
"Growth environment"," Field, wild."
"Other variables"," Saplings grown under closed canopy; Mean annual rainfall provided; Mean annual temperature provided."
"Year collected","2003"
