Latin name of species
Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl., Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud., Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.

Size range
Stem diameter range from 2 to 38.8 cm.

Number of individuals
94

Individual leaf size and Total leaf area
Fresh foliage samples were frozen until they could be analyzed for projected (A. grandis) or all-sided (Pinus species) leaf area. Leaf area of each subsample was measured to the nearest 0.001 cm2. These subsamples were then dried and weighed to the nearest 0.0001 g. Total leaf area was estimated by multiplying total foliage dry weight by SLA.

Area of sapwood, heartwood cross section and/or total stem cross section
Diameter outside bark at breast height (1.37 m) was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm.

Projected crown area 
Area was estimated for each individual.

Total height of plant
Total tree height was measured to the nearest 0.01 m. 

Height of crown
Height to the lowest living branch was measured to the mearest 0.01 m. 

Biomass;Total leaf mass
The crown was divided into thirds. Two whorl branches and noe inter whorl branch were selected at random form each crown third. A random subsample of approximately 100 fresh needles was removed in  proportion to age class representation on the sample branch.

Leaf mass per area
Specific leaf area (SLA) was computed as the ratio of leaf area to dry weight.

Plant functional type
Evergreen gymnosperm

Growth environment of sampled plant
Plantation managed

Treatment
Spacing and species composition.
