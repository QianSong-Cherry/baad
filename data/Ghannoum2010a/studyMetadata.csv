Sampling strategy,"Two eucalyptus species (Eucalyptus saligna and Eucalyptus sideroxylon) were grown at full field capacity under a treatment combination of ambient or elevated temperature (26/18?C or 30/22?C) and subambient, ambient or elevated CO2 (280, 400 or 640 ?L L-1).  Seedlings were grown for 150 days from planting, at which time they were subjected to a destructive harvest of all biomass.  "
