Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Of the 90 tree species of the cloud forest in the Sierra de Manantl√°n Biophere Reserve, Jalisco State, western Mexico  we selected eight trees species common in the understory.  Mature seeds of these 8 species were collected from natural populations and germinated."
Leaf area,"SLA was scanned and calculated  the SigmaScan Pro1 5 software (SPSS Inc., 1999); veins were included. Data of SLA and leaf mass absent in the database for species which lose their leaves seasonally (e.g. Juglans)."
Height,Height was measured for each seedling from the ground surface to the stem apex.
Biomass,"Seedlings were divided in stems, leaves (with petioles) and roots; 10 seedlings per species (5 in Quesal)were randomly harvested at 45 days intervals ( 5 times), 225 days in total.  Plant material was then dried at 80C for at least 48 hours and weighed."
Growth environment,Glasshouse.
Other variables,"Four levels of PAR were used: 3-5% of PAR (a), 8-10% of PAR (b), 18-20% of PAR (c ), 55-60% of PAR (d)."
