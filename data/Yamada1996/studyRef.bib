  abstract = {Crown architecture was analyzed for Scaphium macropodum (Sterculiaceae), a common shade-tolerant emergent tree of a tropical rain forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Saplings and poles shorter than 12 m in height had no branches, and gathered their leaves at the ends of the stem. The leaves changed from entire to palmately-parted with increasing tree size. The parted leaves increased the light penetration through the clustered foliage. The size of leaves including the blade and petiole ranged from 22 cm to 147 cm. Because the weight of petiole per blade increased with leaf size, the leaf could not be enlarged infinitely. Taller trees with lateral branches bore small (about 40 cm in length) entire leaves. The light intensity in the forest increased from the ground to about 12 m tall and was nearly constant from 12 m to 18 m. Crown architecture of S. macropodum adapted to this light environment. The monoaxial trees lower than 12 m could thus increase the amount of light with vertical elongation, and the branched trees higher than 12 m could increase it by means of lateral extension of crown area.},
