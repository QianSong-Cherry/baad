Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sampled Quercus crispula tree was naturally regenerated in a Chamaecyparis obtusa plantation (1040 m a.s.l., 48 years old, slope 20-23 degrees, density 1412 trees/ha, basal area 42.2 square m) and felled on 29 May to 5 June 2000 (Komiyama et al. 2003). A Chamaecyparis obtusa tree was sampled from this stand on 17-31 May 2001. Before felling, stem diameters at 0, 0.3, and 1.3 m height were measured. After felling, tree height, height of the lowest living branch, and stem diameters at crown base were measured. Fresh weights of stem, branches, and leaves were measured."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured after trees were felled (Komiyama et al. 2003)."
Biomass,"Subsamples (ca. 500 g) of each aboveground organ were oven-dried (Komiyama et al. 2003). The dry-to-fresh weight ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry weight of each tree aboveground component. Root biomass was not measured directly and was estimated from root density of soil samples. Therefore, we excluded root biomass from this data paper. "
Other variables,"Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
