"Sampling strategy","The sampled Quercus crispula tree was naturally regenerated in a Chamaecyparis obtusa plantation (1040 m a.s.l., 48 years old, slope 20-23 degrees, density 1412 trees/ha, basal area 42.2 square m) and felled on 29 May to 5 June 2000 (Komiyama et al. 2003). The Chamaecyparis obtusa tree was sampled from this stand on 17-31 May 2001. Before felling, stem diameters at 0, 0.3, and 1.3 m height were measured. After felling, tree height and height and stem diameter at the lowest living branch were measured."
"Stem cross sectional area","Estimated from stem diameter."
"Height","Measured after trees were felled (Komiyama et al. 2003)."
"Biomass","Fresh weights of stem, branches, and leaves were measured. Subsamples (ca. 500 g) of each aboveground organ were oven-dried at 110 degrees C (Komiyama et al. 2003; personal communication). The dry-to-fresh mass ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry mass of each tree aboveground component. Because root biomass was estimated from root density of soil samples, M. Ishihara excluded root biomass from this data set."
"Other variables","Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
