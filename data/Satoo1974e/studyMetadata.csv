Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"Sampling was conducted in a Abies sachalinensis plantation (26 years old, 230-250 m a.s.l.) located in compartment 87-E, Yamabe, the University of Tokyo Hokkaido Forest in central Hokkaido, Japan. Trees were planted in 1937. Details of the stand are listed in Table 1 of Satoo (1974e). A plot of size 0.07 ha were created. Seven sample trees were selected to cover a wide range of diameter and cut down at ground level  in 1960. Stems of sample trees were cut into parts contained in horizontal layers of 0-0.3 m, 0.3-1.3 m, at intervals of 2 m upward upward. Branches were cut into layers of 1 m depth and separated into new shoots with needles, branches with old needles, braches without needles. In addition, four trees were sampled in an adjacent old-growth forest in Yamabe. Methods were the same."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Method not reported."
Biomass,"Stem mass was estimated from volume and bulk density. Stem discs collected from the base of each stem segments were used for stem analysis to obtain stem volume, and then weighted and oven-dried to obtain bulk density. Branch and needle mass was obtained from converting to fresh mass by the ratio of dry to fresh mass. Subsample of each branch category (new shoots with needles, branches with old needles, braches without needles) was taken for each layer and separated into branch and needles, and weighted to assess the ratio of needles to branches and the ratio of dry to fresh mass. "
Other variables,"M. Ishihara, H. Utsugi, H. Tanouchi, and T. Hiura conducted formal search of reference databases and digitized raw data from Satoo (1974e). Based on this reference, meta data was also created by M. Ishihara. Species name and family names were converted by M. Ishihara according to the following references: Satake Y, Hara H (1989a) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants I (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo; Satake Y, Hara H (1989b) Wild flower of Japan Woody plants II (in Japanese). Heibonsha, Tokyo."
