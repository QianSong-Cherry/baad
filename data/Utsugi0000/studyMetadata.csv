Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"10 Larix kaempferi trees were cut at ground level. Stem diameter and tree height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 2 m thickness."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured by measuring tape."
Biomass,"Fresh weights of leaves, branches and stem were measured separately for each layer and tree. Subsamples of each organ were taken and oven-dried. The dry-to-fresh weight ratios of these subsamples were used to calculate total dry weight of each tree component."
Growth environment,"Larix kaempferi managed plantation."
