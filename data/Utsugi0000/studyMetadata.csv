Topic,Description
Sampling strategy,"10 Larix kaempferi trees were cut at ground level. Stem diameter and tree height were measured. Sample trees were then treated with the stratified clip technique by cutting them into parts contained in horizontal layers of 2 m thickness."
Stem cross sectional area,"Estimated from stem diameter."
Height,"Measured by measuring tape."
Biomass,"Fresh weights of leaves, branches and stem were measured separately for each layer and tree. Subsamples of each organ (stem discs, branches, and 10-100 g of fresh leaves) were taken from each layer and oven-dried at 70 degC for 2 days for leaves and for 7 days for branches and stem subsamples. The dry-to-fresh weight ratios of the subsample was used to calculate dry weight of each tree component for each layer."
Growth environment,"Larix kaempferi managed plantation."
