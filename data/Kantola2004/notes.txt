Kantola, A. and M‰kel‰, A. (2004) Crown development in Norway spruce [Picea abies (L) Karst.]. Trees 18, 408-421.

Latin name of species
Picea abies (L) Karst.

Size range
Stem diameter at breastheight ranging from 1.7 to 42 cm.

Number of individuals
29

Area of sapwood, heartwood cross section and/or total stem cross section
The diameter of seven sample disks, from different heights of the tree (including the crown base), was measured for heartwood and sapwood cross sectional area.

Crown projected area and crown surface area 
Crown width was measured in two directionsóthe maximum width and the width perpendicular to it. Projected crown area was estimated as a circle, of which the diameter was the mean of these two measurements

Total height of plant and Height of crown
Heights were measured for each individual.

Biomass;Total leaf mass, branch mass
Ten living sample branches were taken systematically throughout the living crown, such that the crown was divided into ten sections of equal length, and one living branch was taken from each section at random. The fresh sample branches were weighed in the field The dry mass
of needles and branch wood was determined.
