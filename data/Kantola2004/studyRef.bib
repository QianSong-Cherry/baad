  abstract = {This study tests whether crown and stem development in Norway spruce could be described using a modified profile theory. 29 trees from three age-groups (25, 67, 86) with different treatments (unthinned, normally and intensively thinned) were destructively sampled. Crown ratio and crown length varied between age groups and treatments. Crown width was positively correlated with crown length, but branch length along the crown depended on tree age and growing space. Foliage mass density peaked at a relative crown height of 50-70% in middle-aged and mature stands, while young crowns were densest and widest at the base. Foliage mass was predictable from branch and stem cross-sectional area, provided the distance from the top was included. The ratio of foliage mass to branch cross-sectional area increased for 2-4 m down from the tip of the crown, then started to decrease. The relationship between cumulative foliage mass and stem cross-sectional area was non-linear along the stem in the upper crown, but the ratio of cumulative branch to stem cross-sectional area was linear. Trees in the mature and unthinned stands had more cross-sectional area in branches relative to stems than in the young and thinned stands. We conclude that the profile theory needs modification regarding (1) crown shape which varies with age and growing space, and (2) the ratio of foliage mass to branch area which varies along the stem. Both aspects emphasise the need to include impacts of disuse of sapwood pipes in models of crown and stem development.},
