"Sampling strategy","In the young stand (Lapinj√§rvi), 5 trees were sampled from an unthinned plot, while in each of the two older stands (Heinola and Punkaharju), a total of 12 trees were sampled from 3 plots with different thinning treatments, including unthinned control (5 trees sampled), normal commercial thinning (4 trees sampled), and intensive thinning (3 trees sampled). The trees were sampled according to the stem cumulative basal area distribution in each plot (more accurate description in the article)."
"Stem cross sectional area"," Calculated by stem diameter at the  base of the living crown. The stem measured in two directions using a slide gauge."
"Height"," The sample trees were felled and tree height was measured by tape measure from the base of the trunk to the tip of the crown."
"Crown area","This was projected crown area and was estimated as a circle by the measurements of the crown width (Crown width was measured in two directions; the maximum width and the width perpendicular to it)."
"Biomass","The foliage and branch wood biomasses were estimated for each branch in the crown using the measurements of ten randomly sampled branches. The fresh sample branches were measured in the field and then oven dried. The dry mass of needles and branch wood was then determined. The stem basic density estimated from five sample discs (at crown base, 1.3 m, 30%, 70%, and 90% height). The randomly cut sample sectors were separated into sapwood, heartwood and bark fragments, which were measured for volume by immersion, and then oven dried and weighed."
