Questions about the study:  Kantola2004 

1. In your former reply you indicated that your study covers three locations (former question 4), however we need it to be more specific. Could you please indicate in your original data file which individuals were sampled in each of the localities?

2. Could you please provide the standardised growth environment based on the variable definitions file (FW = field wild; FE =field experimental; GH = glasshouse; PU = plantation unmanaged; PM = plantation managed; GC = growth chamber; CG = common garden)?
