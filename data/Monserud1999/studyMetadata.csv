Topic, Description
Sampling strategy, "Two sampling strategies were compared. The first used antithetic sampling of branches within crown quarters; these branches were used with branch diameter measurements throughout the crown to infer whole crown mass estimates. A second strategy was to weigh the green crown by quarters and then use the sample branches to divide total mass into its components. We thus compared a "bottom-up" sample to a "top-down" disaggregation."
Leaf area, "Current foliage was collected from a sample branch and specific leaf area was determined. That value was multiplied by leaf biomass. Leaf area was correlated with sapwood area and basal area at the breast height and at the base of the crown."
Stem cross sectional area,"Determined on sawn cross-sections with image-processing software."
Height, Measured on the ground.
Crown area, "Estimated from branch lengths, which were estimated from regressions on diameter"
Biomass,"Estimated by bottom-up methods from sample branches and by top-down methods from green crown weights."
Traits,"Also specific leaf area, sapwood cross-sectional area, foliated length of branches."
Growth environment,"Field wild."
