	 For your interest, the raw data file you originally sent us and the cleaned data file are both attached.
ANSWER: 

4. Is 'Location data' complete?
	 If not, could you please provide any items marked 'missing' here. The codes and legends for Vegetation_type are provided in the file Variable.definition.csv, also attached.
ANSWER: 

5. Do your locations fall in the right spot in both world and country map?
	 If not, please outline the issues here and provide us with updated longitude and latitude data.

6. Is the 'Stand description' complete?
	 If not, could you please provide more information? Codes and legends for Growing_condition and Status are found within Variable.definition.csv file attached.
ANSWER: 

7. Is the 'Species data' correct, i.e. name, family, plant functional type (pft)?  
	 If not, please provide details where possible.
ANSWER: 

8. Is the 'Methods' information complete and accurate? 
	 If not, could you please provide the missing information in Metadata.csv file attached? These Metadata should be a short description (up to 4 lines) of the methods used for each of the items listed. Additional items not listed in the report are not needed, but if you judge it important, add it to 'Other variables'.
ANSWER: Two sampling strategies were compared. The first used antithetic sampling of branches within crown quarters; these branches were used with branch diameter measurements throughout the crown to infer whole crown mass estimates. A second strategy was to weigh the green crown by quarters and then use the sample branches
to divide total mass into its components. We thus compared a "bottom-up" sample to a "top-down" disaggregation.


Leaf area: current foliage was collected from a sample branch and specific leaf area was determined. That value was multiplied by leaf biomass. Leaf area was correlated with sapwood area and basal area at the breast height and at the base of the crown.
Stem cross-sectional area: determined on sawn cross-sections with image-processing software
Height: measured on the ground
Crown area: estimated from branch lengths, which were estimated from regressions on diameter
Biomass: estimated by bottom-up methods from sample branches and by top-down methods from green crown weights.
Traits: also specific leaf area, sapwood cross-sectional area, foliated length of branches



9. Please review the plots showing how your data compares to other data in the study. Does your data fall well within the rest of the dataset?  Are there outliers? 
	 If so, could you please review the original data file you provided us with and verify that all information is correct.
