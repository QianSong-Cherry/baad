Sampling strategy,"Seventy-three 15-yr-old Pinus taeda trees representing eight half-sib families and an unimproved check were destructively sampled from a single planting block with trees planted on a 1.5m x 3.0m spacing. Only data from 65 trees were included in the 2003 manuscript. Trees were selected from across the range of trees sizes in the block. Allocation patterns of aboveground biomass components were examined. Allometric relationships for estimating leaf area were developed and tested for family differences."
