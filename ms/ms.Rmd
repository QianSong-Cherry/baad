## INTRODUCTION

Quantifying the amount of mass or energy invested in plant tissues is of fundamental interest across a range of disciplines, including ecology, forestry, ecosystem science, and climate change science `r citep(list(bib["niklas_plant_1994"],bib["chave_tree_2005"], "10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01735.x"))`. The allocation of net primary production into different plant components is an important process affecting the lifetime of carbon in ecosystems, and resource use and productivity by plants  `r citep(list(bib["cannell_carbon_1994"],bib["litton_carbon_2007"],bib["poorter_biomass_2012"]))`. While many scientific studies have destructively harvested woody plants, most of the data collected have only been made available in the form of summary tables or figures included in publications. Until now, the raw data has resided piecemeal on the hard drives of individual scientists spread around the world. Several studies have gathered together the fitted (allometric) equations for separate datasets `r citep(list("10.1016/S0378-1127(97)00019-4",bib["jenkins_national-scale_2003"],bib["zianis_biomass_2005"],"10.3832/ifor0901-006"))`, but none have previously attempted to organize and share the raw individual plant data underpinning these equations on a large scale. Gathered together, such data would represent an important resource for the community, meeting a widely recognized need for rich, open data resources to solve ecological problems `r citep(c("10.1016/j.tree.2013.05.002","10.1007/s13595-014-0375-3","10.1038/505160a"))`.

We (D.S. Falster and R.A. Duursma, with the help of D.R. Barneche, R.G. FitzJohn and A. Vårhammar) set out to create such a resource. We identified data sources from existing collaborations as well as a wide-ranging literature search, focussed on woody plants in field as well as controlled conditions. We constrained the search by including only data where a wide range in plant sizes was measured, as well as a set of minimum variables (plant height and leaf mass or area), and an emphasis on field-grown plants (nearly all data from plants grown in controlled conditions arose from existing collaborations). We do not claim to have done an exhaustive search of the literature, due to the very large number of potential studies that could be included. In each case we asked authors directly whether they would be willing to make their raw data files freely available. The response was overwhelming: nearly everyone we contacted was interested to contribute their raw data. Moreover, we were invited to incorporate another compilation led by M.I. Ishihara and focusing on Japanese literature. As a result, we present BAAD: a Biomass And Allometry Database for woody plants, comprising data collected in `r length(unique(data$studyName))` different published and unpublished studies.

Combining data from many different studies, each using its own set of terms and units, and quirks, is no trivial task `r citep(c("10.1890/1051-0761(1997)007[0330:NMFTES]2.0.CO;2","10.1016/j.tree.2011.11.016","10.12688/f1000research.4518"))`. This compilation would not have been possible without several new technologies. In particular,

1. Our entire work flow is scripted, using the R computing environment. The database can be rebuilt in an instant from the raw data files, using a single command. When a single data contribution has been modified, the final master dataset is thus easily recreated.
2. We minimised the amount of code by requiring each study to conform to a common format (Figure 2).
3. We used the package `knitr` within `R` to automatically produce reports comparing the raw data provided by a single study to the rest of the database `r citep(citation("knitr"))`. These reports were sent to data contributors for verification, and thus allowed for easy identification of errors in the raw data or processing. Each report included plots for every pairwise combination of quantitative variables in a given study, site maps, and metadata. The updated reports are available on the database website.
4. We used version control and the code sharing website [github](www.github.com) to track the evolution of the database and the code to process the raw data. Datasets as well as processing methods inevitably contain errors. With version control, we are able to trace these errors to the source.


Until recently, most scientific publications in biology have mostly been concerned with "small data" `r citep("10.1038/nj7461-243a")`. Datasets arrive in small parcels, corresponding to the work of an individual study, or perhaps a handful of studies. It is exciting to be able to put these parcels together, to create something larger. We hope others will use this dataset and build on it. See [https://github.com/dfalster/baad](https://github.com/dfalster/baad) for information on how to contribute to future releases.

## METHODS

## METADATA CLASS I. DATA SET DESCRIPTORS

### A. DATA SET IDENTITY
BAAD: a Biomass And Allometry Database for woody plants

### B. DATA SET IDENTIFICATION CODE:

### C. DATA SET DESCRIPTORS:
**1. Originators**: The study was initiated by D.S. Falster and R.A. Duursma. D.R. Barneche, R.G. FitzJohn and A. Vårhammar assisted with literature searching, data compilation, and coding. A separate compilation focusing on natural forests in Japan, was compiled by M.I. Ishihara, with assistance from T. Hiura, H. Utsugi and H. Tanouchi. All other authors contributed data to the project.

**2. Abstract**: Understanding how plants are plant constructed -- i.e. how key size dimensions and the amount of mass invested in different tissues varies among individuals -- is essential for modeling plant growth, estimating carbon stocks, and mapping energy-fluxes in the terrestrial biosphere. Allocation patterns can differ through ontogeny, but also among coexisting species, and among species adapted to or grown in different environments. While a variety of models dealing with biomass allocation exist, we lack a synthetic understanding of the underlying processes. This is partly due to the lack of suitable datasets for validating and parameterising models. To that end, we present the Biomass And Allometry Database (BAAD) for woody plants. BAAD contains `r sum(!is.na(data[,vars]))` measurements collected in `r length(unique(data$studyName))` different studies, from `r nrow(data)` individuals across `r length(unique(data$species))` species. Most of these data are associated with an existing publication, however, raw data files were rarely made public at time of publication. Thus BAAD contains individual level data from different studies, transformed into standard units and variable names. The transformations were achieved using a common workflow for all raw data files. Other features which distinguish BAAD are: i) measurements were for individual plants rather than stand averages; ii) individuals spanning a range of sizes were measured; iii) inclusion of plants from 0.01-100m in height; and iii) biomass was estimated directly, i.e. not indirectly via allometric equations (except in very large trees where biomass was estimated from detailed sub-sampling). We included both wild and artificially grown plants. The dataset contains the following size metrics: total leaf area; area of stem cross-section, including sapwood, heartwood, and bark; height of plant and crown base, crown area and surface area; and the dry mass of leaf, stem, branches, sapwood, heartwood, bark, coarse roots and fine root tissues. We also report other properties of individuals (age, leaf size, leaf mass per area, wood density, nitrogen content of leaves and wood), as well as information about the growing environment (location, light, experimental treatment, vegetation type) where available. It is our hope that making these data available will improve our ability to understand plant growth, ecosystem dynamics, and carbon cycling in the world's vegetation.

## CLASS III. DATA SET STATUS AND ACCESSIBILITY

### A. Status

**Latest update**: The dataset made available through this publication was processed on 2014-12-10. Newer updates may be retrieved from the BAAD website ([https://github.com/dfalster/baad/](https://github.com/dfalster/baad/).

**Metadata status**: Metadata are complete to last update and are stored with data.

**Data verification**: The raw data passed through several rounds of review, to ensure units were correct, raw data was appropriately matched to variables in BAAD, and to minimize outliers.

i) Initial analysis by data contributors. The majority of studies have been published and as such have gone through quality assurance by the data contributor.
ii) Review by compilers of database. We have gone through extensive data verification by checking cross-correlations, credible ranges, and outliers of all variables in the database.
iii) All species names were matched against online databases with the R packages `Taxonstand` and `taxize` R package `r citep(list("10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00232.x", bib["chamberlain2013taxize"]))`.
iv) Additional review by contributors using reports generated from the data.  In these reports, we summarized species, locations (latitude, longitude and maps), plant functional type, metadata provided by the contributor, and pair-wise plots of all numeric variables in the dataset (and a comparison to all data in the database). Each contributor checked the reports for problems, which allowed us to improve data quality in many cases.
v) Derived variables were calculated from the raw data where appropriate. For example, a dataset may contain crown length and plant height but not height to crown base, in which case the latter was calculated from the other two variables.

### B. Accessibility
