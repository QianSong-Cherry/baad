	abstract = {We studied the evolution of leaf size, sapling canopy allometry, and related traits in 17 Acer species growing in the understory of temperate deciduous forests, using parsimony methods, randomization tests, and independent contrasts calculated on idena phylogeny inferred from nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer ({ITS)} sequences. Bivariate correlations and multivariate analyses indicated two independent suites of coevolving traits, and the results were robust over a range of alternative phylogenies. The first suite consisted of strong positive correlations among twig thickness, leaf size, inflorescence length, and branch spacing (Corner's rules). Seed size and mature height were also weakly corre‐ lated with these traits. The second suite reflected aspects of sapling crown allometry, including crown size, stem diameter, and total leaf area, which appear to be related to shade tolerance. There was a weak negative correlation between sapling crown size and mavegetative ture height, but no correlation with leaf or seed size. Most correlattion were similar in magnitude for ahistorical and independent contrasts analyses, and discrepancies between these two measures were greater in traits with lower levels of convergent evolution. The evolutionary correlations among twig, leaf, seed, inflorescence, and canopy dimensions emphasize the need for integrated theories of evolution and function of these disparate traits.},

	abstract = {* Background and Aims Inevitable trade-offs in structure may be a basis for differentiation in plant strategies. Juvenile trees in different functional groups are characterized by specific suites of structural traits such as crown architecture and biomass distribution. The relationship between juvenile tree structure and function was tested to find out if it is robust among functionally and taxonomically similar species of the genus Shorea that coexist sympatrically in a tropical rain forest in Borneo. * Methods The sapling structures of 18 species were compared for standardized dry masses of 5 and 30 g. Pairwise simple correlation and multiple correlation patterns among structural traits of juveniles (0\{middle dot\}1-1\{middle dot\}5 m in height) of 18 Shorea species were examined using Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis ({PCA)}, respectively. The correlation was then tested between the {PCA} results and three indices of shade tolerance: the net photosynthetic rate, the wood density of mature trees and seed size. * Key Results The structural variation in saplings of the genus Shorea was as large as that found in sets of species with much more diverse origins. The {PCA} showed that both crown architecture and allocation to leaves are major sources of variation in the structures of the 18 species investigated. Of these two axes, allocation to leaves was significantly correlated with wood density and showed a limited correlation with photosynthetic rate, whereas crown architecture was significantly correlated to seed size. * Conclusions Overall, the results suggest that an allocation trade-off between leaves and other organs, which co-varied with wood density and to a certain extent with photosynthetic capacity, accounts for the difference in shade tolerance among congeneric, functionally similar species. In contrast, the relationship between the architecture and regeneration strategy differed from the pattern found between functional groups, and the function of crown architecture was ambiguous.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. Above-ground structure was analysed in saplings of 56 sympatric species in a Bornean rain forest with consideration of the phylogenetic background to elucidate interspecific variation in the dry-mass cost and its ecological consequences. 2. The extension cost (total above-ground mass) in 1.5-m tall saplings varied eightfold among the 56 species. However, no significant differences in extension cost were observed among saplings of three crown types (branched, monoaxial simple-leaved, and monoaxial compound-leaved), although the monoaxial crown type has been considered an adaptation for achieving rapid height growth. The lack of differences arose because the advantages of monoaxial saplings in structural cost for displaying a given leaf area were unexpectedly small. 3. Understory species had a significantly higher extension cost than canopy species because of their thicker, and consequently, heavier trunks. This trend was common to the three crown types; thus, the higher extension cost was not caused by the prevalence of a specific crown type in understory species. 4. For all 56 species combined, the trade-off between height growth efficiency and light-interception-enhancing morphology was prominent. This structural trade-off, which makes efficient vertical growth incompatible with survival in the understory, potentially enables the stable coexistence of these species in a temporally heterogeneous light environment.

	abstract = {Question:  What environmental factors and physiological traits determine the juvenile survival rates of 11 dipterocarp species (Dipterocarpaceae) co-occurring in a Bornean tropical rain forest?
Location:  Tropical northwestern Borneo.
Methods:  In 248 quadrats, distributed over 12 ha, the juvenile (height{\textless} 2.0 m) survival of 11 shade-tolerant dipterocarp species was monitored for one year. The probability of survival for each species was expressed as a logistic function of plant height and three environmental factors: canopy openness, soil water potential and conspecific individual density. The correlation between survival under shaded conditions and several physiological traits of juveniles was tested by normal Pearson correlation and a phylogeny based manner using independent contrasts.
Results:  Seven species had increased survival under more open canopies, one species had increased and two species had decreased survival at drier sites. Six species had higher survival as the density of conspecifics increased, whereas two species had lower survival. The magnitudes of the effects for the three environmental factors were similar. However, the interspecific difference in survival was largely determined by a dependence of small seedlings on the light environment. Survival under low light was correlated positively with root dry mass and negatively with total leaf area of juveniles.
Conclusions:  Responses of seedlings to the fine-scale gradient of light availability were considerably different among the 11 species. Species that suffered increased mortality under low light had a set of structural traits that would potentially allow rapid growth under bright conditions. Differential performance along the light gradient may contribute to the stable coexistence of these species.},

The sapwood basal area and the needle dry weight were obtained by destructive sampling for 153 Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) from 16 stands in central Sweden. The regression relationship between needle mass and sapwood basal area was strong for single stands, but it did not seem appropriate to aggregate the material into one overall regression, having sapwood basal area as the only independent variable. It was shown that the needle biomass per unit of sapwood basal area varied with mean annual ring width in the sapwood. This information was used in an improved overall model.},

	abstract = {1. Demography and allometry of the dioecious tree Cecropia obtusifolia were studied in a 5-ha permanent plot at Los Tuxtlas rain forest, Mexico. Treefall gaps were aged and a significant positive correlation was found between gap age and tree size. Active regeneration of the species was suggested by the high proportion ({\textgreater}35\%) of young individuals. The population was highly clumped among young juvenile trees and became less aggregated as density within-gaps decreased among older trees. New and successful recruitment was restricted to recently formed ({\textless}3 years since opened) and large ({\textgreater} 100-m{\textasciicircum}2) gaps. Oldest individuals (35 m high) were growing in 37-year-old gaps. 2. Tree height and stem diameter increased allometrically with a slope {\textless}1.5 in trees {\textgreater}0.3 m tall. The margin between the actual tree diameter (d) and the theoretical minimum buckling diameter (dmin.) declined exponentially from c. 20 in juvenile trees to almost 1 in the oldest trees ({\textgreater}30 years old). Whilst the number of leaves remains fairly constant before branching, it increases linearly as the number of branches increase. Changes in area per leaf during the life cycle yield an overall allometric pattern between tree height and total leaf area. 3. Seed and seedling mortality was {\textgreater} 99\%. Reduced light, falling debris, movement of rotting logs and soil dryness were important mortality factors in pre-reproductive stages. Oldest adults died standing, apparently due to senescence. Maximum life expectancy is reached when trees attain a non-suppressed canopy position (c. 20 m high). Individuals showed high growth rates (a stem-diameter increment of up to 2 cm year -1). Growth-rate variation in juvenile stages seem to be related to high environmental heterogeneity. In adult stages the number of conspecifics growing in the same gap seems to affect diameter growth rate negatively. First reproduction occurred at about 3 years of age (when 10 cm in diameter) and increased with age. Annual fecundity rates of individuals ranged from 1.4 × 104 to 1.4 × 107 seeds and increased allometrically with stem diameter and number of branches. 4. The most important environmental filter in the life-cycle of C. obtusifolia operates from the seedling to the juvenile stage. This finding does not support the suggestion that pioneer limitation to gap regeneration is determined during germination. The allometric and demographic traits of C. obtusifolia correspond to those expected for a shade-intolerant species that colonizes ephemeral sites, and they contrast with those of purported shade-tolerant tree species reported in the literature. However, rather than finding two clearly distinguishable types of life-histories, a continuum of demographic life-cycles was found. Therefore, the dichotomous pioneer-climax framework should be viewed as a means of identifying the extremes of a continuum of tree life histories.},

	abstract = {Abstract   We studied the effects of photon flux density ({PFD)} and leaf position, a measure of developmental age, on the distribution of nitrogen content per unit leaf area (N area) in plants of different heights, in dense stands grown at two nitrogen availabilities and in solitary plants of the erect dicotyledonous herb Xanthium canadense. Taller more dominant plants received higher {PFD} levels and experienced a larger difference in relative {PFD} between their youngest and oldest leaves than shorter subordinate plants in the stands. Differences in {PFD} between leaves of solitary plants were assumed to be minimal and differences in leaf traits, found for these plants, could thus be mainly attributed to an effect of leaf position. In the solitary plants, N area decreased with leaf position while in the plants from the stands it decreased with decreasing relative {PFD}, indicating both factors to be important in determining the distribution of N area. Due to the effect of leaf position on N area, leaves of subordinate plants had a higher N area than older leaves of dominant plants which were at the same height or slightly higher in the canopy. Consequently, the N area distribution patterns of individual plants plotted as a function of relative {PFD} were steeper, and probably closer to the optimal distribution which maximizes photosynthesis, than the average distribution in the stand. Leaves of subordinate plants had a lower mass per unit area ({LMA)} than those of dominant plants. In the dominant plants, {LMA} decreased with decreasing relative {PFD} (and with leaf position) while in the subordinate plants it increased. This surprising result for the subordinate plants can be explained by the fact that, during the course of a growing season, these plants became increasingly shaded and newer leaves were thus formed at progressively lower light availability. This indicates that {LMA} was strongly determined by the relative {PFD} at leaf formation and to a lesser extent by the current {PFD.} Leaf N content per unit mass (N mass) was strongly determined by leaf position independent of relative {PFD.} This indicates that N mass is strongly ontogenetically related to the leaf-aging process while changes in N area, in response to {PFD}, were regulated through changes in {LMA.}},

	abstract = {The aboveground biomass content of a region can be estimated by either direct or indirect methods. The direct method corresponds to sampling the biomass content by weighing and extrapolating results to larger areas. It is a destructive and very laborious procedure. The indirect method utilizes formulas whose predictor parameters are obtained from forest inventories. Forest inventories are conducted with the purpose of planning exploitation and land use, and the data derived from inventory are frequently not suitable for biomass estimation. Problems with both these methods increase in the Amazon region, where little information is available on forest biomass. The objective of this paper is to compare a number of biomass equations taken from previous studies and establish an appropriate mathematical formula to estimate the vegetation weight of a particular region in the Amazon forest. A 0.2\&\#xa0;ha area of `terra firme' forest was chosen for the comparison. This effort was part of a major forest clearing experiment conducted in Tomé Açu, a town located 250\&\#xa0;km south of Belém, the capital of the Brazilian state of Pará. The entire biomass in the 0.2\&\#xa0;ha area was weighed. A detailed inventory was carried out in the area prior to the cut and then the biomass was estimated with the inventory data inserted in the selected equations. Fourteen different biomass equations taken from previous studies were used. A comparison of the data of real mass and the mass obtained through the application of the fourteen formulas indicated that the two formulas more suitable for the region are given by (a) {FW=αDβHγ}, where {FW} is total fresh weight (kg), D the diameter at breast height (cm), H the total height of the tree (m) and α, β, and γ the regression coefficients, equal to 0.026, 1.529, and 1.747, respectively, and (b) {FW=αDβ/(1−M)}, where α and β are 0.465 and 2.202, respectively, and M the moisture content, defined in terms of mass of moisture per unit mass of fresh biomass. The aboveground fresh biomass weight predicted by the above equations were within ±0.6\% of the weight determined in the field.},

For P. radiata forest, 23\% of the demand for N and 34\% of the demand for P was not supplied by cycling but came from soil reserves. In contrast, only 4\% of the demand for N of E. obliqua, and only 10\% of the demand for P, came from soil reserves. These differences largely reflect the nutritional stage of development of the stands. Nevertheless, P. radiata has a greater absolute requirement for P than Eucalyptus, and this has implications for the management of fast-growing pine plantations on soils of relatively low P-status.},

For species showing a response, both increased light and nutrient availability resulted in increased {WPLCP.} However, species’ responses to resource availability did not correspond closely with shade tolerance as has generally been predicted. Variation in {WPLCP} within species was best predicted by whole-plant dark respiration rates, leaf-level light compensation point and leaf mass per area. Among species, seed size was a strong negative correlate of {WPLCP}, explaining 66\% of the variation. Species with the lowest {WPLCP} maintained lower growth rates across treatments but greater biomass in the low-light treatment compared with more light-demanding species. These data suggest that a number of traits, in particular metabolic costs and seed size, contribute to {WPLCP.} However, gas-exchange-based {WPLCP} was 1.5–3.5 times lower than corresponding growth-based field estimates of {WPLCP}, suggesting that other factors such as biotic interactions or ontogenetic shifts in whole-plant light requirements may substantially increase species’ {WPLCP} under natural conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract 1. Shade tolerance, defined as the ability to survive and grow under low light, varies markedly among tree species. However, the role of low-light growth responses in determining shade tolerance is unclear, as are the effects of non-light resources such as soil nutrients. 2. A conceptually simple field measure of shade tolerance is the whole-plant light compensation point ({WPLCP)}, evaluated as the x-intercept of the relationship between growth and incident light integrated over a long time interval. Here we compare {WPLCP} for growth and survivorship of saplings of Bornean tree species differing in shade tolerance, and evaluate the importance of various physiological and morphological traits in predicting {WPLCP.} We also examine both phenotypic and evolved differences in {WPLCP} between tree saplings growing on two distinct soil types at Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia. 3. Growth-based estimates of {WPLCP} showed essentially a 1 : 1 correspondence to threshold light levels for survivorship. At higher light, more light-demanding species showed higher growth, resulting in a steeper slope of the relationship between relative growth rate ({RGR)} and light availability than in more shade-tolerant species. This resulted in significant crossovers in the {RGR-light} relationship among species. 4. Dark respiration (Rd) was the single best predictor of {WPLCP;} other leaf traits such as leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity were correlated with, but excluded as predictors of, {WPLCP} in multiple regression analyses. 5. Although soil type had no consistent phenotypic effect on {WPLCP}, evolved responses among species were pronounced: species associated with the nutrient-poor, drought-prone, sandstone-derived soils had higher {WPLCP} values than alluvial soil specialists in phylogenetically controlled comparisons. 6. Our results indicate that minimum light levels for growth do not diverge from those for survivorship, and do not support the view that low-light survivorship solely determines shade tolerance. Our analyses also suggest that Rd is the strongest determinant of whole-plant light requirements in tropical tree saplings, and thus may be an easily measured surrogate of {WPLCP} and shade tolerance. 7. Prediction of tree species resource requirements is crucial for understanding forest dynamics and promoting ecology-based forest management and restoration, particularly in diverse tropical forests where data on the resource requirements of most species are not available. Easily measured surrogates of resource requirements (e.g. Rd as a predictor of shade tolerance) will contribute to this goal, as will an improved understanding of the interactive effects of multiple resources on tree performance.

	abstract = {The hydraulic limitation hypothesis proposes that (1) reduced growth in taller trees is caused by decreased photosynthesis resulting from a decrease in hydraulic conductance promoted by a longer root-to-leaf flow path, and (2) this mechanism reduces stand productivity after canopy closure. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the physiology of 7 m (1 year) and 26 m (5 year) Eucalyptus saligna plantations where above-ground productivity for the 26 m trees was approximately 69\% of that for the 7 m trees, and water and nutrients were not limiting. The study compared whole tree physiology [water flux (Ql), average crown conductance ({GT)}, crown hydraulic conductance per unit leaf area ({KL)}, carbon isotope discrimination ({δ13C)]} and leaf physiology under light saturation (leaf water potential at the canopy top ({ΨLEAF)}, photosynthetic capacity (Amax), and photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs). {KL} was 50\% lower in the taller trees, but whole tree Ql and {GT} were the same for the 7 m and 26 m trees. Photosynthetic capacity was the same for leaves at the canopy top, but {δ13C} was −1.8‰ lower for the 26 m trees. A and gs were either lower in the taller trees or equal, depending on sampling date. The taller trees maintained 0.8 {MPa} lower {ΨLEAF} during the day and had 2.6-times higher sapwood area per unit leaf area; these factors compensated for the effects of increased height and gravitational potential in the taller trees to maintain higher {GT.} The hydraulic limitation hypothesis (as originally stated) failed to explain the sharp decline in net primary productivity after canopy closure in this study. The effects of increased height appear to be a universal hydraulic problem for trees, but compensation mitigated these effects and maintained Ql and {GT} in the present study. Compensation may induce other problems (such as lower {ΨLEAF} or higher respiratory costs) that could reduce carbon gain or shift carbon allocation, and future studies of hydraulic limitation should consider compensation and associated carbon costs. In this study, the combination of similar {GT} and lower {δ13C} for the 26 m trees suggests that total crown photosynthesis was lower for the 26 m trees, perhaps a result of the lower {ΨLEAF.}},

Nonlinear models on dbh explained more than 90\% of the biomass variance; regressions improved when tree height was used as well. Crown dimensions increased with stem size. A linear relationship was found between basal area and crown length. Crown projection area was nonlinearly related to leaf area and crown biomass. The fraction of dry matter present in the stem generally increased with tree biomass, but differently for trees from different diameter classes. The ratio between leaf and branch biomass decreased significantly with increasing tree size. The ratio between leaf biomass and leaf area ({SLA)} was relatively constant for whole trees, amounting on average to 172 cm 2 g-1. {SLA} generally increased from the tree top down to the crown base; this pattern did not significantly differ among trees within a stand. The rate of change decreased with decreasing canopy closure. A strong linear relationship existed between leaf area and sapwood area: the ratio was affected by the height of the crown base.

Seven of the 18 species accumulated greater total biomass at the humid site than at the dry site over a two-year period. Species-specific biomass partitioning among leaves, branches and trunks was observed. However, a wide range of total biomass found among species (from 1.06\&\#xa0;kg for Dipteryx panamensis to 29.84\&\#xa0;kg for Acacia mangium at Soberania) justified the used of an Aitchison log ratio transformation to adjust for size. When biomass partitioning was adjusted for size, a majority of these differences proved to be a result of the ability of the tree to support biomass components rather than the result of differences in the regional environments at the two sites. These findings were confirmed by comparative {ANCOVAs} on Aitchison-transformed and non-Aitchison-transformed variables. In these comparisons, basal diameter, height and diameter at breast height were robust predictors of biomass for the pooled data from both sites, but Aitchison-transformed variables had little predictive power.},

only wood volume for timber production, but also biomass accumulation and carbon
sequestration rates of their forests for environmental purposes. The common methods of
biomass estimation have been to develop allometric equations to predict the biomass of
individual trees from diameter or both diameter and height. The biomass equations are
usually based on small samples, especially for large trees, due to the time-consuming
nature of destructive biomass sampling. Consequently, the predictive performance of
biomass equations has been seldom evaluated. Most forest management agencies do,
however, have reliable volume estimates that are based on large samples. Converting
stem or stand volume estimates, that are already available in forest inventory and growth
and yield systems, to biomass seems to be the most convenient and reliable way to
estimate forest biomass over a large management area. Adopting this approach, we
developed a system of additive equations for converting stem volume into four biomass
components (stemwood, bark, branches, foliage) and total above-ground tree biomass
using data for two Australian tree species as an example. To correct log transformation
bias and at the same time maintain additivity among the component equations, we
proposed a regression-based bias correction factor and simultaneously estimated the
biomass correction factors for the component equations. The distributional properties of
the error in stem volume prediction were incorporated in stochastic simulations of the
system of equations to determine the confidence bands of the biomass conversions. Such
results would provide a clear indication whether the required precision of biomass
prediction is met for a particular objective of investigation and, if not, where improvements

Besides logical consistency, a system of additive biomass equations when estimated by taking into account the inherent correlation among the biomass components has greater statistical efficiency than separately estimated equations for individual components. Using mostly small sample data from both published and unpublished sources, a system of non-linear additive biomass equations was developed for 15 native eucalypt forest tree species of temperate Australia. Diameter at breast height was used as the independent variable for all 15 species, while the combined variable of diameter and tree height was used for 14 species with height data. The system of additive equations provided more accurate biomass estimates than the common approach of separately fitting total tree and component biomass equations using log transformed data through least squares regression. Residual error variances were collectively estimated for each species by pooling small sample data across species and using indicator variables to represent the scale factor for each species in a residual variance function. This method overcame a common problem in estimating heteroscedastic error variance in non-linear biomass equations with additive error terms for small samples. From the estimated residual variance functions, approximate confidence bands containing about 95\% of the observed data about the mean curve of predicted biomass were derived for all biomass components of each species. This system of additive biomass equations will prove to be useful for biomass estimation of native eucalypt forests of temperate Australia.},

	abstract = {Abstract  
Forest growth is important both economically (yielding billions of dollars of annual revenues) and ecologically (with respect
to ecosystem health and global carbon budgets). The growth of all forests follows a predictable general trend with age. In
young forests, it accelerates as canopies develop; it then declines substantially soon after full canopy leaf area is reached.
The classic explanation for the decline in growth invoked the increasing respiration costs required to sustain the larger
masses of wood characteristic of older forests. Direct measurements of respiration have largely refuted this hypothesis, and
recent work has focused on stand-level rates of resource supply, resource use, and growth. We developed and tested a hypothesis
at the scale of individual trees (in relation to stand structure) to explain this declining stand-level rate of stem growth.
According to our hypothesis, changes in stand structure allow dominant trees to sustain high rates of growth by increasing
their acquisition of resources and using these resources efficiently (defined as stem growth per unit of resource used); smaller,
nondominant trees grow more slowly as a result of their more limited acquisition of resources and a reduced rate of growth
per unit of resource acquired. In combination, these two trends reduce overall stand growth. We tested this hypothesis by
comparing growth, growth per unit of leaf area, and variation among trees within plots in two series of plantations of Eucalyptus in Brazil and by estimating individual-tree rates of growth and use of light, water, and nutrients in a plantation of Eucalyptus saligna in Hawaii. Our results supported the individual-tree hypothesis. We conclude that part of the universal age-related decline
in forest growth derives from competition-related changes in stand structure and the resource-use efficiencies of individual
trees.},

	abstract = {The growth of wood in trees and forests depends on the acquisition
  of resources (light, water, and nutrients), the efficiency of
  using resources for photosynthesis, and subsequent partitioning
  to woody tissues. Patterns of efficiency over time for individual
  trees, or between trees at one time, result from changes in rates
  photosynthesis and shifts in the relative partitioning to wood.
  We measured the production ecology (stem growth, light interception,
  and light use efficiency) to explain patterns of growth among
  trees within plots through stand development, and tested three
  hypotheses: (1) dominant trees have higher light use efficiency
  than subordinate trees; (2) lower variation in the size distribution
  of trees within plots allows higher light use efficiency; and
  (3) uniform stand structure and high light use efficiency reduce
  the age-related decline in tree growth. The experiment used clonal
  plantations of Eucalyptus at four locations in eastern
  Brazil. Irrigation and fertilization treatments ensured themajor
  resource limitation for tree growth would be light supply. The
  influence of variation in the sizes of trees within plots was
  tested by comparing plots with all trees planted in a single
  day (uniform treatment) with plots where planting was spread
  over 80 days (heterogeneous treatment). Light interception per
  tree was simulated with the {MAESTRA} model. Across sites, treatments
  and wholerotation stand development, dominant trees showed higher
  rates of stem growth, light interception, and light use efficiency
  than subordinate trees (supporting the first hypothesis). For
  example, dominant trees (80th percentile rank) at the end of
  the rotation grew four-times faster than suppressed trees (20th
  percentile rank), as a result of 2.1-fold greater light interception,
  and 1.8-fold greater stem growth per unit of light interception.
  In some cases, greater variation among tree sizes within plots
  led to lower efficiency of light use by average-size trees, providing
  mixed evidence for the second hypothesis. Greater uniformity
  of sizes of trees within plots did not substantially mitigate
  the decline in stem growth from mid-rotation to the end of the
  rotation, refuting the third hypothesis. The high efficiency
  of dominant trees underscores the marginal contribution of subordinate
  trees to total stand growth, and should spur further work on
  thinning to increase growth and lengthen rotations for dominant
  trees.},

While a linear relationship has been observed between {LAI} and forest productivity, most of these data have been collected in needle-leaved evergreen stands. The generality and consistency of the relationship between {LAI} and productivity has not been as well established for deciduous forests. Leaf area index ({LAI)} and aboveground net primary production ({ANPP)} were measured on 16 forest stands in the southern Appalachian Mountains. These stands span a range of elevation, slope position, temperature, and moisture regimes. {LAI} averaged 5.8 m2 m-2 and ranged from 2.7 to 8.2 {ANPP} averaged 9.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and ranged from 5.2 to 11.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1. {LAI} and {ANPP} decreased significantly from cove to ridge sites, and {ANPP} decreases significantly from low to high elevation (P {\textless} 0.05, linear regression slope). Elevation-related differences in {ANPP} do not appear to be due to changes in precipitation, leaf nitrogen content, or site N mineralization rates. Linear {ANPP-LAI} equations fit to the data measured in this study were significant (P {\textless} 0.05). These relationships were not significantly different (P {\textgreater} 0.1) from linear relationships based on data reported in most other studies of {ANPP} and {LAI} in eastern deciduous forests of North America. However, the slope of a linear regression model based on North American eastern deciduous forests was significantly different (P {\textless} 0.05) from one based on data collected in temperate deciduous forests for the rest of the globe. The differences were slight over the range of observed data, however, and the difference may be due to a narrower range of data for North American deciduous forests.},

	abstract = {A critical factor in estimating the contribution of tropical deforestation to nutrient mobilization and to {CO2} build-up in the atmosphere is the amount of biomass available to burn. The biomass data for Brazil, a major site for deforestation, are few and of uncertain accuracy. Recent international agreements, however, require national inventories of sources and sinks for atmospheric greenhouse gases; such inventories will need better estimates of biomass and their uncertainties. To provide additional information on biomass uncertainty and on forest structure in southwestern Amazonia, a region of active deforestation, we measured in 1988 the diameter, bole and canopy heights of 474 trees covering a total of 1 ha (10 000 m2) in the Ecological Station of the Samuel Hydroelectric Reservoir in Rondônia ({845′S}, {63°23′W).} Using allometric equations based on destructively sampled trees, we estimated the largest biomass component, standing alive aboveground biomass ({SAAB)}, as 285 Mg (dry weight) ha−1. Fallen trunks and litter were 30 Mg and 10 Mg ha−1, respectively. The sum of these components, 325 Mg ha−1, is an underestimate of the total biomass because the biomass of roots, vines, shrubs, and small trees was not measured. Measurement error of {SAAB} is ± 20\%, ± 57 Mg ha−1 about the mean (95\% confidence interval), as derived by a Monte Carlo simulation. The {SAAB} distribution among trees is highly skewed: 3\% of the trees contain 50\% of the {SAAB.} For forests of similar distributions, sampling units typically used for biomass estimates (less than 2000 m2) will usually produce biomass estimates significantly different from those of larger units. Based on subsamples of our data, sampling units of 1000 m2 or smaller had at least a 75\% chance of being outside the confidence interval of the global mean (228–342 Mg ha−1) derived from Monte Carlo simulation. To improve estimates of {SAAB} in similar forests a sampling program should focus on emergent and large canopy trees, the dominant contributors to biomass.},

	abstract = {Forest biomass estimates are used to help quantify pools and flux of greenhouse gases (e.g., {CO2–C)} from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere associated with land-use and land cover changes. Such estimates based on direct measurements are quite limited for tropical dry forests. The goal of this study was to assess the species composition and biomass density in an intact Mexican forest representative of the tropical dry forest biome. We then compared our measured biomass with biomass estimates computed with a published model in current use. A total of 72 species were found in a 0.5\&\#xa0;ha stand with a basal area of 31.3\&\#xa0;m2\&\#xa0;ha−1. The dominant species, in terms of biomass, were Brosimum alicastrum Sw., Manilkara zapota (L.) Royen, Luehea speciosa Wildl., Pouteria unilocularis (Donn. Sm.) Baehni, Trichilia minutiflora Standl., and Spondias mombin Linn. Tree heights ranged up to 30\&\#xa0;m and dbh to 82.1\&\#xa0;cm. Species-specific biomass regression models were developed for the six most common species of large (\&gt;10\&\#xa0;cm\&\#xa0;dbh) trees and for the nine most common species of small (\&lt;10\&\#xa0;cm\&\#xa0;dbh) trees from the destructive harvest of 698 trees. Mass of large trees (n=195) were used to derive the regression model Y=exp\{−2.173+0.868\&\#xa0;ln({D2\&\#xa0;TH)+0.0939/2\}}, where Y is the total dry weight (kg), D the dbh (cm), and {TH} the total height (m). Total aboveground tree biomass was estimated to be {225\&\#xa0;Mg\&\#xa0;ha−1}, and was dominated (85\%) by the biomass of the large trees. The actual biomass of each of the 195 large trees was compared to individual tree biomass calculated with a published regression model [Estimating biomass and biomass change of tropical forests. A primer. {FAO} Forestry Paper 134. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy, 1997] that is based on measurements of 29 trees. We found that the published model underestimated biomass of these trees by 31\% (37.6 versus {54.4\&\#xa0;Mg).} Calculated biomass was less than measured biomass for 29 of 33 species. The current study points to the value of site-specific assessment of aboveground biomass and may contribute to more accurate estimates of dry tropical forest biomass densities currently used to estimate greenhouse gas flux from land management activity.},

	abstract = {Old forests are generally believed to exhibit low net primary productivity ({NPP)} and therefore to be insignificant carbon sinks. This relationship between age and {NPP} is based, in part, on the hypothesis that the biomass of respiratory tissues such as sapwood increases with age to a point where all photosynthate is required just to maintain existing tissue. However, this theoretical connection between respiration:assimilation ratios and forest productivity is based on age-dependent trends in the sapwood:leaf ratios of individual trees and even-aged stands; it does not take into account such processes in natural forests as disproportional increases in shade-tolerant species over time and multiple-age cohorts. Ignoring succession and structural complexity may lead to large underestimates of the productivity of old forests and inaccurate estimates of the ages at which forest productivity declines. To address this problem, we compared biomass allocation and productivity between whitebark pine, a shade-intolerant, early-successional tree species, and subalpine fir, a shade-tolerant, late-successional species, by harvesting 14 whitebark pines and nine subalpine firs that varied widely in dbh and calculating regression models for dbh vs annual productivity and biomass allocation to leaves, sapwood, and heartwood. Late-successional subalpine fir allocated almost twice as much biomass to leaves as early-successional whitebark pine. Subalpine firs also had a much lower allocation to sapwood and higher growth rates across all tree sizes. We then modeled biomass allocation and productivity for 12 natural stands in western Montana that were dominated by subalpine fir and whitebark pine varying in age from 67 to 458 years by applying the regressions to all trees in each stand. Whole-stand sapwood:leaf ratios and stand productivity increased asymptotically with age. Sapwood:leaf ratios and productivity of whitebark pine in these stands increased for approximately 200–300 years and then decreased slowly over the next 200 years. In contrast, sapwood:leaf ratios of all sizes of subalpine fir were lower than those of pine and productivity was higher. As stands shifted in dominance from pine to fir with age, subalpine fir appeared to maintain gradually increasing rates of whole-forest productivity until stands were approximately 400 years old. These results suggest that forests such as these may continue to sequester carbon for centuries. If shade-tolerant species that predominate late in succession maintain high assimilation-to-respiration ratios in other forests, we may be underestimating production in old forests, and current models may underestimate the importance of mature forests as carbon sinks for atmospheric {CO} 2 in the global carbon cycle.},

A generalized biomass equation for a species and a region can be used. Alternatively, such tree characteristics as bole geometry and wood density of the trees to be measured can be matched with those characteristics of trees for which a regression equation is available. We consider this latter technique will give more accurate biomass predictions, particularly in stands that differ from the regional average. The applicability of biomass equations to other populations could be more easily assessed if five relevant and easily collected pieces of information were presented. These are: (1) mean {DBH;} (2) mean height; (3) mean {DBH/height} ratio; (4) mean absolute form quotient; and (5) mean wood density.

These recommendations are illustrated with new biomass estimation equations of two forms for Populus tremuloides for each of four geographic regions in western Canada. Differences between equations for the four regions occurred. Two descriptors of tree shape, absolute form quotient and the {DBH/height} ratio, also differed among regions. The {DBH/height} ratio and height were both correlated with the accuracy of ready-made biomass estimation equations.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass ({AGB).} We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees ≥ 5 cm diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of {AGB} of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5–6.5\% when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Shifts in rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures associated with climate change are likely to cause widespread forest decline in regions where droughts are predicted to increase in duration and severity1. One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure2, 3, 4. Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70\% of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow ({\textless}1 megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe5, 6. Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk7, 8.},

Several boreal and sub-boreal Abies, Picea and Pinus species were studied along a light (0–90\% full sunlight) and size (30–400-cm high) gradient to examine the interactive influence of tree size and light availability on aboveground biomass distribution. Sampling was conducted in two regions of Canada: (A) British Columbia, for Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt., the Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss × P. engelmannii Parry ex. Engelm. complex and Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.; and (B) Québec, for Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea glauca (Moench. Voss) and Pinus banksiana (Lamb.).
All biomass distribution traits investigated varied with size, and most showed a significant interaction with both size and light, which resulted in increasing divergences among light classes as size increased. For example, the proportion of needle mass decreased as size increased but the rate of decrease was much greater in saplings growing at below 10\% full sunlight. Needle area ratio (total needle area:aboveground mass) followed a similar pattern, but decreased more rapidly with increasing tree size for small trees up to 1 m tall. The proportion of needle biomass (needle mass ratio) was always lower in taller trees (i.e., {\textgreater} 1 m tall) than in small trees ({\textless} 1 m tall) and increasingly so at the lowest solar irradiances (0–10\% full sunlight). Thus, extrapolating the functional response to light from small seedling to taller individuals is not always appropriate.},

A discriminant analysis based upon a combination of allocational and architectural traits clearly distinguished functional types and classified species according to successional status at a 100\% success rate. For a given plant diameter, the pioneer species presented similar root biomass compared to the non-pioneer ones but higher cumulative root length and a higher number of root apices. A detailed study on the root system of a sub-sample of three species showed that the most late-successional species ( Tabebuia rosea ) had longer root internodes and a higher proportion of root biomass allocated to the taproot compared to the other two species ( Hura crepitans and Luehea seemannii ). Most pioneer species showed a higher leaf area ratio due to a higher specific leaf area ({SLA).} We conclude that the functional differences between pioneer and non-pioneer tree species found in natural forests were maintained in open-grown plantation conditions.},

Coarse root biomass (over 10 mm diameter) was assessed by complete excavation and fine root biomass (10 mm or less in diameter) by coring.

Tree biomass (above and below ground) was linearly related to {D2H} and to cross-sectional area of the stem. Above ground biomass estimates predicted by the equations developed in this study were smaller than those predicted by published multi-species equations. However, adjusting the estimates to take account of differences in timber density, brought the predictions closer to those from existing equations.

Root biomass found in this study was larger than in previous work. The root: shoot ratio was significantly (P \&lt; 0.05, r2 = 60\%) and positively correlated with tree size ({D2H).} The fitted regression equation was Rootshoot=0.223+0.0199×2h where D is stem diameter at breast height (m) and H is tree height (m). The mean root/shoot ratio based on this study and recalculation of other published studies from moist tropical forests was about 0.25.

Fine root amounts increased as forests aged from less than 1 year to 30 years, but there were no significant differences in fine root biomass between forests aged 30 (about 9 t ha−1) and mature forest.

Branch surface area was positively correlated (r2 = 0.95) with leaf area.},

Franco) saplings in 60- to 80-year-old thinned Douglas-fir stands in southwestern Washington. We separately quantified belowground competition from overstory and understory sources using trenching and understory removal. In this light-limited environment of 26 ± 16\% (std. dev.) full sunlight, 2-year exclusion of tree root competition by trenching increased sapling stem biomass by 18\%, total aboveground biomass by 21\%, number of interwhorl buds by 68\%, total foliar biomass by 33\%, and foliar biomass on branch components over 4 years old by 143\%. Belowground competition did not influence shoot:root ratio or foliar efficiency (i.e., stem growth per unit foliage biomass). Sapling needle size, specific leaf area, and internodal distance also were not affected by belowground competition; these variables were apparently a function of the low-light environment. The principal source of belowground competition was roots of overstory trees; effects of belowground competition from understory vegetation were minor. Thus, under a partial overstory, morphology of Douglas-fir regeneration was influenced by both belowground and aboveground competition from overstory trees. In this environment, understory vegetation control would not likely influence belowground competition to an extent that would affect sapling morphology.},

	abstract = {Moist tropical forests in Africa and elsewhere store large amounts of carbon and need accurate allometric regressions for their estimation. In Africa the absence of species-specific or mixed-species allometric equations has lead to broad use of pan moist tropical equations to estimate tree biomass. This lack of information has raised many discussions on the accuracy of these data, since equations were derived from biomass collected outside Africa.

Mixed-species regression equations with 71 sample trees using different input variables such as diameter, diameter and height, product of diameter and height, and wood density were developed to estimate total aboveground biomass and biomass of leaves and branches for a Cameroon forest. Our biomass data was added to 372 biomass data collected across different moist tropical forests in Asia and South America to develop new pan moist tropical allometric regressions. Species-specific and mixed-species height diameter regression models were also developed to estimate heights using 3833 trees.

Using only diameter as input variable, the mixed-species regression model estimates the aboveground biomass of the study site with an average error of 7.4\%. Adding height or wood density did not improve significantly the estimations. Using the three variables together improved the precision with an average error of 3.4\%. For general allometric equations tree height was a good predictor variable. The best pan moist tropical equation was obtained when the three variables were added together followed by the one which includes diameter and height. This study provides height diameter relationships and wood density of 31 species. The pan moist tropical equation developed by Chave et al. (2005), estimates total aboveground biomass across different sites with an average error of 20.3\% followed by equations developed in the present study with an average error of 29.5\%.},

	abstract = {Introduction Knowledge of vertical variation in hydraulic parameters would improve our understanding of individual trunk functioning and likely have important implications for modeling water movement to the leaves. Specifically, understanding how foliage area ( A l ), sapwood area ( A s ), and hydraulic specific conductivity ( k s ) vary with canopy position to affect leaf-specific conductivity ({LSC)} and whole-tree leaf-specific hydraulic conductance ( K l ) may explain some of the contrasting patterns of A l / A s reported in the literature. Objective The general aim of the study was to characterize and compare the aboveground relationships between cumulative A l , A s , and k s for two Pacific Northwest coniferous species with contrasting sapwood areas to give insight into size-related design of trees for water transport through changes in {LSC} and K l . Results The 230-year-old ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) trees had slightly smaller basal diameters than the 102-year-old Douglas-fir ( Pseudostuga menziesii ) trees, but contained 85\% sapwood at the base compared to 30\% in Douglas-fir. At the tree base, there was no evidence that A l / A s decreased with tree age or with tree size. In both species, A l / A s of branches was significantly higher than A l / A s at the tree base, but it was not different from A l / A s measured in the trunks at the top of the tree. Douglas-fir had higher A l / A s at the base than did ponderosa pine (0.42 vs. 0.24 m 2 cm −2 ), similar patterns of change in A l / A s with height, and similar values of k s , such that {LSC} in Douglas-fir was 77\% the value of {LSC} in ponderosa pine. Compensating changes to increase {LSC} between short and tall trees occurred through an increased in k s in tall trees but not through a reduction in A l . {LSC} increased logarithmically with branch path length or trunk path length whereas K l decreased significantly from top to base of old trees, but not between sections from old and young trees of similar cambial age. Conclusions Even though ponderosa pine had three times more sapwood than Douglas-fir, this study revealed a common relationship of declining K l with increasing tree height and diameter between the two species, within age classes and among trees. There was no compensating decrease in A l / A s as trees got taller, which showed that a homeostasis in K l was not maintained during growth. The trend of higher allocation of biomass to sapwood over leaves in ponderosa pine is consistent with this species’ tendency to inhabit drier sites than Douglas-fir.},

	abstract = {1. West et al. [Science, 284 (1999) 1677] derived an optimal body-size scaling exponent under the assumption that resources are evenly distributed among exchange surfaces, leading to the well-known ¾ scaling rule. In trees, this implies a volume-filling branching network (a fractal dimension of 3 for foliage). However, there is evidence that the fractal dimension is less than 3 in trees. 2. Here, we include self-shading in the derivation of optimal fractal dimensions. With self-shading, resources are not evenly distributed among leaves because light enters the crown at the surface and is gradually attenuated within the crown. We find that the optimal fractal dimension can take values between 2 and 3, depending on light interception properties and crown size. 3. For a large data set on foliage and woody biomass in gymnosperm trees, we confirm that the fractal dimension of foliage is less than 3, and that it shows a weak dependence on crown size. However, foliage biomass scaled with crown woody biomass with an exponent of 0·78, very close to the theoretical expectation of ¾ scaling. This can be explained by a deviation from the theoretical prediction in the scaling of crown woody biomass and crown length. 4. Overall, these results confirm a deviation from volume filling in gymnosperm trees, and we provide an explanation for this deviation in terms of optimal metabolic scaling. Because ¾ scaling of foliage biomass is still approximately valid, this implies that metabolic scaling exponents may not be as tightly linked to the fractal dimension of foliage as previously assumed.},

	abstract = {Understanding the underlying mechanisms that account for the impact of potassium (K) fertilization and its replacement by sodium (Na) on tree growth is key to improving the management of forest plantations that are expanding over weathered tropical soils with low amounts of exchangeable bases. A complete randomized block design was planted with Eucalyptus grandis (W. Hill ex Maiden) to quantify growth, carbon uptake and carbon partitioning using a carbon budget approach. A combination of approaches including the establishment of allometric relationships over the whole rotation and measurements of soil {CO2} efflux and aboveground litterfall at the end of the rotation were used to estimate aboveground net production ({ANPP)}, total belowground carbon flux and gross primary production ({GPP).} The stable carbon isotope ({δ13C)} of stem wood α-cellulose produced every year was used as a proxy for stomatal limitation of photosynthesis. Potassium fertilization increased {GPP} and decreased the fraction of carbon allocated belowground. Aboveground net production was strongly enhanced, and because leaf lifespan increased, leaf biomass was enhanced without any change in leaf production, and wood production ({PW)} was dramatically increased. Sodium application decreased the fraction of carbon allocated belowground in a similar way, and enhanced {GPP}, {ANPP} and {PW}, but to a lesser extent compared with K fertilization. Neither K nor Na affected {δ13C} of stem wood α-cellulose, suggesting that water-use efficiency was the same among the treatments and that the inferred increase in leaf photosynthesis was not only related to a higher stomatal conductance. We concluded that the response to K fertilization and Na addition on {PW} resulted from drastic changes in carbon allocation.},

Carbon fraction in the biomass, mean (±standard deviation), for the different pools varied between 38.5 and 49.7\% (±3 and 3.8). Accumulated carbon in the biomass increased with the plantation age, with mean annual increments of 7.1 and 5.3 Mg ha −1 year −1 for forest plantations of V. guatemalensis and H. alchorneoides , respectively. At all ages, 66.3\% (±10.6) of total biomass was found within the aboveground tree components, while 18.6\% (±20.9) was found in structural roots. The soil (0–30 cm) contained 62.2 (±13) and 71.5\% (±17.1) of the total carbon (biomass plus soil) under V. guatemalensis and H. alchorneoides , respectively. Mean annual increment for carbon in the soil was 1.7 and 1.3 Mg ha −1 year −1 in V. guatemalensis and H. alchorneoides . Allometric equations were constructed to estimate total biomass and carbon in the biomass which had an R 2 aj (adjusted R square) greater than 94.5\%. Finally, we compare our results to those that could have resulted from the use of default values, showing how site and species specific data contribute to the overall goal of improving carbon estimates and providing a more reliable account of the mitigation potential of forestry activities on climate change.},

Nine mangrove stands were studied, each composed of three to ten adjoining plots with areas that varied depending on the density of the populations. Structural parameters and indices were calculated. Individuals representative of the three groups of taxa present were {felled:Avicennia} germinans (L) Stearn, Rhizophora spp., and Laguncularia racemosa (L) Gaertn. The trunks, branches and leaves were sorted and weighed separately. The biomass was obtained by determining the allometric relationships, the general equation selected being of the type y = \$a\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{o\}\}x{\textasciicircum}\{a\_\{1\}\}\$ , where the diameter (x) is the predictive variable. The total above-ground biomass varied from 31 t ha-1 for the pioneer stages to 315 t ha-1 for mature coastal mangroves, but with large variations depending on the structural characteristics at each site. The results place the Guianese mangroves among those with high biomass, although lower than those reported for Asia. Based on the relationships between structural parameters and standing biomass, in particular with the use of the "self-thinning rule", population dynamics models are proposed.},

Relative and absolute foliage distributions on individual trees were estimated by building branch-level leaf area models for grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.), and ponderosa pine (Pinusponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) and then estimating foliage distribution for entire crowns. Branch leaf area declined at the base of the live crown in all tree species, reinforcing the importance of accounting for branch position within the crown. Tree-level foliage distributions responded to differences in stand structure imposed by initial spacing and species composition. Foliage distribution also differed by tree social position within the stand. The effect of species composition and tree social position diminished with increasing spacing. Species with differing levels of shade tolerance can be quite plastic in the amount and vertical distribution of foliage in response to stand structure.},

	abstract = {The principal objective of this study was to investigate the variations of allometric relationships, biomass stocks and biomass allocation in a Spanish juniper thermophilic community (Juniperus thurifera var. hispanica Mill.) in response to two levels of woodland maturity: mature woodlands, which are situated in shallow stony soils with trees over 140\&\#xa0;years old and low tree density, and young woodlands, with trees under 100\&\#xa0;years old growing in deeper soils (generally, abandoned farmland). Branch- and tree-level allometric models were fit from measurements carried out on branches, stems and roots in 42 felled trees. Although age and site are confounded for this juniper community, it is expedient to utilize site-specific equations because the two woodlands showed distinct growth patterns as a result of their very different soil qualities and ages. At the branch level, the relationship was matched for foliage biomass depending on the site. At the tree level, site location significantly affected variables in allometric relationships that were not strictly cumulative (i.e., leaves, branch wood and fine-root biomass). Goodness of fit was improved by including the relative height of the first live whorl (pruning effect) as an additional predictor of crown and coarse root biomass. The young woodland supported more biomass stock across all components due to better soil. Biomass allocation measured in stems, coarse roots and fine roots was significantly higher in the mature woodland, although the young woodland did accumulate more dry mass in the crown. Differences in biomass allocation may be explained by both the age and strategies of J. thurifera to maximize nutrient and water capture for survival in poor soils (site quality effects). Our results also showed that, in mature woodlands, this species accumulates one of the smallest biomass stocks cited for temperate mature conifer stands ({7.6\&\#xa0;Mg\&\#xa0;ha−1)} but has a high root to shoot ratio (0.43) as a consequence of growing in poor soil conditions.},

We determined biomass accumulation and allometric relationships in the partitioning of biomass between aboveground woody biomass, leaves and roots in Nothofagus antarctica. We measured above- and belowground biomass of N. antarctica trees across different ages (5–220 years) and crown classes (dominant, codominant, intermediate and suppressed) in three site qualities. The biomass allocation patterns were studied by fitting allometric functions in biomass partitioning between leaves ({ML)}, stem and branches ({MS)} and roots ({MR).} These patterns were tested for all pooled data and according to site quality and crown classes. Biomass accumulation varied with crown class and site quality. The root component represented 26–72\% of the total biomass depending on age and site. N. antarctica scaling exponents for the relationships {ML} vs. {MS}, {MA} vs. {MR}, and {MS} vs. {MR} were close to those predicted by the allometric biomass partitioning model. However, when biomass allocation was analyzed by site quality the scaling exponents varied following the optimal partitioning theory which states that plants should allocate more biomass to the part of the plant that acquires the most limiting resource. In contrast, the crown class effect on biomass partitioning was almost negligible. In conclusion, to obtain accurate estimations of biomass in N. antarctica trees the allometric approach appears as an useful tool but the site quality should be taken into consideration.},

	abstract = {We studied developmental and environmental constraints on leaf dynamics, morphology and physiology in the monopodial tropical palm of the Atlantic Forest biome, Euterpe edulis. Plastic responses to light environments in terms of photosynthesis, leaf size, leaf life span, patterns of biomass allocation and growth were analysed. Plants were grown during 14 months in a shade house under four different growth irradiances. Plants of Euterpe edulis were able to adjust leaf demography and biomass allocation in the different light treatments. Leaf life span increased by 100 days with decreasing light levels while the rate of leaf production decreased, consistent with lower electron transport rates. At low light levels, adjustments in biomass allocation to leaf components allowed E. edulis to reduce self-shading and increase light interception. At high light plants allocated more biomass to roots, and the plants exhibited small leaf sizes when leaves were compared using an explicit ontogenetic analysis. Ontogeny constrained the maximum size that each consecutive leaf could achieve, while growth irradiance determined the rate of leaf production and other leaf traits. Consequently, there were both, developmental constraints and environmental determinants influencing leaf demography and morphology in E. edulis. The findings of this ecophysiological and demographic study are relevant to palms growing under natural conditions and help to explain the success of E. edulis in the forest understory and its absence from large gap openings. Our results not only confirm that E. edulis is a shade tolerant species, but also show that palms are able to acclimate to different growing condition as well as trees.},

	abstract = {Reliable estimates of plant biomass and leaf surface area are essential for studying primary production, nutrient cycling, hydrology, wildlife management, and fire. This paper presents equations that can be used to make such estimates for most plant species-trees, shrubs, and herbs-dominant in western and central Oregon.' We also document the methods used for each equation (such as locations and sizes of sampled plants), summarize statistical attributes (sample sizes, variances, rz ), and reference previously published data. Most of the equations presented here are a product of the Coniferous Forest Biome, part of the United States' participation in the International Biological Program ({IBP).} The original studies focused on undisturbed oldgrowth forests (more than 450 years old) of Pseudotsuga menziesii. Followup studies still underway are evaluating the responses of those same systems to perturbations, especially clearcutting, and the importance of streamside vegetation. Therefore, most equations apply best to three basic habitats, all in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon: mature coniferous forests, streamside (riparian) zones, and clearcuttings less than 10 years old. The vegetation and microclimates of these areas have been detailed by Dyrness (1973), Franklin and Dyrness (1973), Dryness et al. (1974), and Zobel et al. (1976). Sometimes we tried to make an equation represent a broader range of habitats. For example, Grier and Logan (1977) already used about half the data from our Pseudotsuga menziesii equations to derive others heavily weighted toward old-growth forests in the west-central Cascade Mountains of Oregon (Appendix B, Reference 4). Because we felt that a set of equations for predicting average plant biomass on diverse sites would be more useful than one tailored to a particular area or habitat, our Pseudotsuga menziesii equations are composites of five data sets collected throughout the Pacific Northwest. Note that our equations for Pinus ponderosa, Oplopanax horridum, and Pinus contorta used data from areas outside the Pacific Northwest..

Twelve trees were felled, their stumps were excavated, and the {CSA} of sapwood and heartwood were estimated for individual roots, entire root systems, and stem section. – • Root sapwood {CSA} was greater than sapwood {CSA} throughout the stem, and the ratio of leaf area to sapwood {CSA} (A l {:A} s ) was accordingly lower for root sapwood. The relationship between sapwood {CSA} and leaf area was more variable in roots and at groundline compared to crown base. Root A l {:A} s decreased with relative tree height (tree height/mean stand height). – • The strong allometric relationship between leaf area and the {CSA} of sapwood in the stem generally holds when extended to roots. The greater {CSA} of sapwood in roots versus stems may reflect differences in their roles in supporting the tree.},

In the three youngest stands (4, 8 and 11 years) understorey age was the same as overstorey; understorey age was 9 years in the 36-years-old forest and 14 years in the mature stand. Sites were chosen in pure stands of E. diversicolor with understories dominated by Trymalium spathulatum and the legume Bossiaea laidlawiana. Highest stem densities were found in the youngest stands and there was a large variation in stem sizes for the major species in older stands.

In stands aged 4–36 years, total aboveground biomass ranged from 31 t/ha for the 4-year-old stand to 249 t/ha for the 36-year-old stand. Understorey represented approximately 50\% of aboveground biomass in the 8- and 11-year-old stands, and 10\% of biomass in the 4- and 36-year-old stands. B. laidlawiana made up between 50 and 94\% of understorey aboveground biomass in all stands, with leaves representing 6–8\% of plant top weight. Biomass of large roots of understorey species was low (0.3–5.0 t/ha) compared with aboveground understorey biomass. It was estimated that biomass of fine roots of all species was about 3 t/ha in the older stands in late summer.

Although there were large differences in biomass between stands, average rates of accumulation of organic matter were similar for the 4–36-year-old stands. Comparison of average rates of biomass accumulation for trees and understorey shrubs indicated that a large proportion of annual aboveground organic matter production in E. diversicolor forest was associated with the understorey. Periodic fuel reduction burning in E. diversicolor forest results in regular regeneration of the understorey and may explain the high rates of understorey biomass accumulation compared with other eucalypt forests in which fire is excluded.},

The use of D\_0.1{\textasciicircum}{2H} (D\_0.1, stem diameter at a height of H/10; H, tree height ) as an independent variable of the allometric equation made the equation applicable to any hinoki stands for estimating the weight of organs, such as stem, branches, leaves, roots, and aboveground per tree. In the case of the estimation of the branch weight, the use of stem diameter D\_8 at a height of clear bole length increased accuracy of the estimates to a considerably higher extent. For the leaf weight, it was advisable either to use D\_8 or branch weight as an independent variable. With respect to leaf area, it was proved that accuracy of the estimates based on leaf weight was quite high. As far as the root weight was concerned, the use of {DGH} resulted in more accurate estimates than the use of D\_0.1{\textasciicircum}{2H} or stem weight as an independent variable.

enhanced epicormic growth when juvenile, often resulting from

proportion of the butt and other elements common to all stems.
Significant allometric relationships, using both the commonlyapplied
log-transformed method, and a recently proposed additive
error method, were developed between stem diameter at breast
height and at 30 cm above ground, tree height and width, and the
dry weights of each aboveground component. These relationships

We purposefully sampled 528 trees ranging 5–100 cm diameter at breast height growing in a range of light conditions. Across ten broad-leaved species observed in Sumatra or Kalimantan, a generic relationship was found between light exposure of the crown and a light-dependent a l parameter that modifies the height–diameter allometric equation ( H = a l D b ) from those for closed stands. In our results, vertical stretching is well predicted by light availability. In fully open conditions, trees are on average 31\% shorter for the same diameter than under (partial) shade. Most of the stretching response occurs in all species as soon as some degree of lateral shading occurs. The response, however, varies by species (8–44\% reduction) in a way apparently unrelated to species’ successional status. Crown volume varied less than stem height in its relationship with stem diameter across all light conditions tested. The scaling of crown volume with stem diameter, however, differed markedly between tree species.},

Leaves sampled from the open plot had significantly higher rates of light-saturated gross photosynthesis and dark respiration, and a significantly lower specific leaf area than leaves from the other plots. The relative growth rate of whole plant biomass was significantly higher in plots that received larger amounts of light. The variations in these properties under the various light conditions are considered to reflect the ability of hiba seedlings to adapt to available light. In the late autumn, leaves sampled from the open and from the gap under deciduous trees indicated photoinhibition. However, the estimated value of monthly net photosynthesis of hiba seedlings was greater in these plots, indicating that the benefit of a greater light intensity for photosynthesis seems to be larger than the detriment of photoinhibition. The seasonal pattern of photosynthesis by understory hiba seedlings was affected by the phenology of canopy trees. Light availability under the canopy of deciduous trees associated with phenological gaps helped hiba seedlings to tolerate the relatively dark conditions during the subsequent foliation period. These results for reaction to the light regime and for the phenology of hiba seedlings are practicable for hiba forest management.},

In order to test this hypothesis, the divergence in allometry and shoot dynamics in saplings of Japanese beech ( Fagus crenata ) obtained from four populations and having different leaf sizes were examined in a nursery under both full sun and shade conditions. Trees with different leaf sizes also showed large differences in canopy structure, particularly when shade-grown saplings were compared. The final leaf mass distributions of the large-leaf populations were conical or “bottom - heavy”, while those of the small-leaf populations were planar or “top - heavy”. The slope of the allometric relations between leaf mass and shoot and branch mass in small-leaved populations were steeper than those in large-leaf populations. The four populations were classified into two growth types: populations producing a few large leaf and shoot modules corresponded to “stem growth type”, and those producing many small leaf and shoot modules corresponded to “leaf growth type”. These kinds of intra-specific variation in architecture and growth of F. crenata trees may influence the structure and dynamics of forests in accordance with differences in competitive ability or sensitivity to disturbances such as windstorm.},

	abstract = {Leaves are the key active sites for energy and matter transfer in plants, and therefore the total one-sided area of leaves per square metre of ground (leaf area index, {LAI)} is a critical variable used for scaling up from plant to ecosystem level properties. A commonly held belief is that {LAI} remains constant during the self-thinning phase of stand development, and allometric relationships between tree density, mean tree size and leaf area (or leaf mass) are frequently used to provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed thinning relationships. We investigated variations in leaf allometry, stand {LAI} and other canopy properties along a developmental sequence of naturally occurring mono-specific self-thinning stands of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) in New Zealand. Stand age had a consistent significant effect on both the slope and the intercept of both the leaf mass and the leaf area allometric relationships (increasing slope, decreasing intercept). This was due to trees of a given basal area having more leaf area (or leaf mass) when growing in a neighbourhood of smaller trees, than equivalently sized individuals surrounded by a lower density of trees larger than itself. A peaked (non-constant) relationship was observed between {LAI} and stand age during self-thinning, with the mean {LAI} values peaking in intermediately aged large sapling stands (7�08) compared with the small sapling stands (5�42) and older pole stands (5�70). Stand level leaf mass per unit area ({LMA)} varied with canopy height and stand age, being highest at the top of canopies and in older stands. We propose that the observed increase in canopy depth during the early stages of stand development (but after canopy closure has occurred) could be driving the increase in stand {LAI} due to a more even distribution of light within the canopy. Our findings suggest that the commonly held assumption of constant {LAI} should be abandoned in favour of the notion of leaf area being at a dynamic maximum during self-thinning, with the maximum possible leaf area being influenced by age-related changes in canopy structure that occur during stand development.},

	abstract = {Eucalyptus plantations occupy almost 20 million ha
  worldwide and exceed 3.7 million ha in Brazil alone. Improved
  genetics and silviculture have led to as much as a three-fold
  increase in productivity in Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil
  and the large land area occupied by these highly productive ecosystems
  raises concern over their effect on local water supplies. As
  part of the Brazil Potential Productivity Project, we measured
  water use of Eucalyptus grandis x urophylla clones
  in rainfed and irrigated stands in two plantations differing
  in productivity. The Aracruz (lower productivity) site is located
  in the state of Espirito Santo and the Veracel (higher productivity)
  site in Bahia state. At each plantation, we measured stand water
  use using homemade sap flow sensors and a calibration curve using
  the clones and probes we utilized in the study. We also quantified
  changes in growth, leaf area and water use efficiency (the amount
  of wood produced per unit of water transpired). Measurements
  were conducted for 1 year during 2005 at Aracruz and from August
  through December 2005 at Veracel. Transpiration at both sites
  was high compared to other studies but annual estimates at Aracruz
  for the rainfed treatment compared well with a process model
  calibrated for the Aracruz site (within 10\%). Annual water use
  at Aracruz was 1394 mm in rainfed treatments versus 1779 mm in
  irrigated treatments and accounted for approximately 67\% and
  58\% of annual precipitation and irrigation inputs respectively.
  Increased water use in the irrigated stands at Aracruz was associated
  with higher sapwood area, leaf area index and transpiration per
  unit leaf area but there was no difference in the response of
  canopy conductance with air saturation deficit between treatments.
  Water use efficiency at the Aracruz site was also not influenced
  by irrigation and was similar to the rainfed treatment. During
  the period of overlapping measurements, the response to irrigation
  treatments at the more productive Veracel site was similar to
  Aracruz. Stand water use at the Veracel site totaled 975mm and
  1102mm in rainfed and irrigated treatments during the 5-month
  measurement period respectively. Irrigated stands at Veracel
  also had higher leaf area with no difference in the response
  of canopy conductance with air saturation deficit between 
{treatments.Water}
  use efficiency was also unaffected by irrigation at Veracel. Results
  from this and other studies suggest that improved resource availability
  does not negatively impact water use efficiency but increased
  productivity of these plantations is associated with higher water
  use and should be given consideration during plantation management
  decision-making processes aimed at increasing productivity.},

	abstract = {This study tests the hypothesis that the aboveground structure of silver birch (Betula pendula L.) is derivable from crown rise across a range of social positions of trees. Data were measured in 30-year-old birch monocultures of three different initial spacings. As suggested by the pipe model, there was a strong linear correlation between the total cross-sectional area of branches and that of stem at crown base. Foliage mass correlated with stem basal area at crown base. An allometric relationship was found between foliage mass and crown length, and the mean length (weighted by basal area) of branches correlated linearly with crown length. Pipe ratios of branches and foliage were found to be independent of slenderness (= tree height / breast height diameter). The proportion of stem in aboveground biomass increased from 80\% to 96\% when the slenderness index increased, the proportions of branches and leaves decreasing, respectively. For crown biomass, the proportion of foliage was greater in the more slender stems, accompanied with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of stems, while the share of branches remained rather constant. The ratio of productive (foliage) and nonproductive (stem plus branches) biomass inside the crown was positively correlated with slenderness, but in the whole tree, the ratio declined with increasing slenderness. The results of this study support the theory of functional balance and seem to be in conflict with the priority principle of allocation.},

	abstract = {High developmental plasticity at the seedling-level during acclimation to the light environment may be an important determinant of seedling establishment and growth in temperate broadleaf forests, especially in dense understories where spatial light availability can vary greatly. Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) seedlings were raised beneath a range of artificial light environments (high light, partial high light and low light) to examine morphological and photosynthetic acclimation to vertically stratified light availability. Acclimation observed at the seedling level included changes in proportional distribution of biomass and leaf area ratio to enhance either light gathering under low light availability or reduction of moisture stress under high light availability. Seedling-level acclimation was partially driven by plasticity at the flush level, but plasticity of traits determining flush morphology, such as leaf number, area, and mass, was largely controlled during bud formation rather than during shoot development. Therefore, flush-level acclimation was restricted when shoots elongated from a shaded environment into a high light environment. In contrast, traits influencing leaf-level acclimation, such as leaf thickness, specific leaf area, and pigment concentrations appeared to be driven primarily by the prevailing light environment during leaf development. The plastic response in leaf traits to light environments during shoot development enabled immediate acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to the prevailing light environment. In conclusion, oak seedlings displayed a large phenotypical plasticity on multiple levels that maximized whole seedling performance.},

	abstract = {It is essential to study forest biomass, which is an important quantity character for forest ecosystems. Although intense studies have been carried out on the biomass of Larix olgensis plantations, little attention was paid on the dynamics of biomass and carbon storage with age structure variation. We researched the age structure effect on forest biomass and carbon storage by investigating its vertical distribution of Larix ologensis plantations. For many years excessive cutting and slighting fostering, the stand quality and the function of forest ecosystem have descended in Dong Zhelenghe forestry centre of Yi Chun, China. By analyzing the vertical distribution biomass of different components for Larix ologensis plantations in a homogenous site condition, the biomass distribution in age sequence was studies. The study was aimed to provide the quantitative reference for improving the productivity and carbon storage by adjusting the stand structure. The proportions of trunk, bark and living branch biomass were less correlated with age structure, but that of leaves decreased with stand growth significantly. We analyzed vertical distribution of biomass for different components in varying-age stands. The relationship between biomass and tree height showed a uniform pattern among age structures. The bark- and trunk-biomass descended with tree height, and that of living branches and leaves concentrated in middle of tree canopy, while the dead-branches biomass appeared less difference vertically. The biomass proportions of coarse, medium and fine roots decreased with stand age, but opposite for main-root biomass. The relationship between stand biomass and stock volume was fitted as {W=0.4909M+9.6624(R2=0.8893).} We know from the estimated results that the total biomass of Larix olgensis young plantations in the study area was 1273.72t/hm2, and carbon storage 656.98 {t/hm2.The} total biomass of middle-age forests was 15480.13 t/hm2, or carbon storage 7984.65 t/hm2 as.

Allometric equations relating dry weights of stemwood, bark, branches and needles to stem diameter were developmed to predict tree biomass. The proportions of tree components changed with tree size and stand age. Total biomass increased with plantation age and stood at 161.24 t h−1 in the 15-year-old stand. The mean annual biomass production was 10.75 t ha year−1 over the 15-year period. The data on mean periodic increment and net primary production showed that the rate of biomass accumulation was highest between 5 and 7 years, during which a peak of 19.18 t ha−1 year−1 in net primary production was attained.

Stand nutrient contents increased with plantation age and were largely in the order nitrogen (N) \&gt; potassium (K) \&gt; calcium (Ca) \&gt; magnesium (Mg) \&gt; phosphorus (P). Average rates of nutrient accumulation increased rapidly in the early stages of stand development but changes in nutrient content were less marked as the stand age increased. With increasing stand age, biomass increment was more towards the bole, but nutrients were preferentially accumulated in the needles. The concentrations of nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) decreased in the following order: needles\&gt; branches\&gt;stembark\&gt;stemwood.},

Crown ratio and crown length varied between age groups and treatments. Crown width was positively correlated with crown length, but branch length along the crown depended on tree age and growing space. Foliage mass density peaked at a relative crown height of 50–70\% in middle-aged and mature stands, while young crowns were densest and widest at the base. Foliage mass was predictable from branch and stem cross-sectional area, provided the distance from the top was included. The ratio of foliage mass to branch cross-sectional area increased for 2–4 m down from the tip of the crown, then started to decrease. The relationship between cumulative foliage mass and stem cross-sectional area was non-linear along the stem in the upper crown, but the ratio of cumulative branch to stem cross-sectional area was linear. Trees in the mature and unthinned stands had more cross-sectional area in branches relative to stems than in the young and thinned stands. We conclude that the profile theory needs modification regarding (1) crown shape which varies with age and growing space, and (2) the ratio of foliage mass to branch area which varies along the stem. Both aspects emphasise the need to include impacts of disuse of sapwood pipes in models of crown and stem development.},

Measurements of basal diameter (D 10 ) at 10cm aboveground and total height (H), and aboveground biomass of 27 trees were taken, but only nine trees representative of variability of the stand and the three species were processed for functional branching analyses ({FBA)} of the shoot systems. For each species, fractal properties of three trees, including fractal dimension (D fract ), bifurcation ratios ( p ) and proportionality ratios ( q ) of branching points were assessed. The slope of the linear regression of p on proximal diameter was not significantly different (P \&lt; 0.01) from zero and hence the assumption that p is independent of scale, a pre-requisite for use of fractal branching rules to describe a fractal tree canopy, was fulfilled at branching orders with link diameters \&gt;1.5 cm. The proportionality ration q for branching patterns of all tree species was constant at all scales. The proportion of q values \&gt;0.9 (f q ) was 0.8 for all species. Mean fractal dimension (D fract ) values (1.5–1.7) for all species showed that branching patterns had an increasing magnitude of intricacy. Since D fract values were ≥1.5, branching patterns within species were self similar. Basal diameter (D 10 ), proximal diameter and D fract described most of variations in aboveground biomass, suggesting that allometric equations for relating aboveground tree biomass to fractal properties could accurately predict aboveground biomass. Thus, assessed Acacia, Gliricidia and Leucaena trees were fractals and their branching properties could be used to describe variability in size and aboveground biomass.},

The study sites were originally classified as mainly lowland dipterocarp forest and have been selectively logged in the past 20 years. In total, 30 individuals from 27 species were harvested to measure above-ground parts. The correlation coefficients for the allometric relationships obtained for total above-ground biomass as a function of dbh had high values (0.99), although the relationships for leaf biomass had a relatively low coefficient (0.83). We also found relatively high coefficients for allometric relationships between tree height and plant-part biomass, ranging from 0.82 to 0.97. Moreover, there were no differences for allometric equations of total above-ground biomass between study sites. A comparison of equations of above-ground biomass in various previously reported tropical rainforests and pan-tropic general equations imply that our allometric equations differ largely from the equations for tropical primary forests, early successional secondary forest, and even for the general models. Therefore, choosing the biomass estimation models for above-ground biomass in the logged-over forests of Southeast Asia requires careful consideration of their suitability.},

	abstract = {Estimates of forest biomass are needed for tracking changes in C stocks, as well as for other purposes. A common method for estimating forest biomass is through use of allometric equations which relate the biomass of individual trees to easily obtainable non-destructive measurements, such as diameter. A common form is {B=aDb} for biomass B, diameter D and parameters a and b. Field data collected in Sumatra and compared with previously published data show that the values of a and b vary between sites. This variation is likely to be the major source of uncertainty if biomass estimates are produced using equations that are not calibrated for individual sites. However, calibration by collection of B and D data for each site is unrealistic, requiring destructive measures. Methods of choosing values for a and b are, therefore, proposed that do not require destructive measurements. The parameter b can be estimated from the site-specific relationship between height (H) and diameter, {H=kDc} as b=2+c. The parameter a can be estimated from the average wood density (ρ) at the site as a=rρ, where r is expected to be relatively stable across sites. The allometric equation proposed is therefore {B=rρD2+c.}},

	abstract = {Leaf spacing and aboveground growth were monitored in saplings of ten species in a range of light environments in a Panamanian lowland humid forest. One- to 2-m-tall individuals of the chosen species had intermediate to large leaves on stems with few or no branches. Saplings in high light environments grew faster in height and produced more biomass per unit leaf area than shaded saplings for all species. These growth responses involved morphological plasticity with greater extension per unit biomass increment increasing the height growth rate of gap-grown saplings and greater biomass allocation to leaves decreasing the whole plant light compensation point in shade. The relative performance of the species also varied across the light gradient and was related to differences in leaf lifespan and specific leaf mass. Light-demanding species grew as rapidly in shade as shade-tolerant species, but the shorter leaf lifespan of the former necessitates higher production rates to maintain a given leaf area, largely excluding light-demanders from shaded understory locations. Height growth rate was positively correlated with leaf spacing for each species, and differences between species in the height growth rate-internode length relationship were related to interspecific differences in specific leaf mass. Thus, sapling growth histories may be inferred from their morphologies.},

The study showed that allometric differences between species are related to adult size, regeneration niche (gap vs. non-gap) and longevity, as follows: (1) adults of understorey species are larger crowned than similar statured (6-15 m) saplings; of canopy trees; (2) species commonly found in gaps as saplings are somewhat larger crowned than shade-tolerant species over the 1-6 m height range; and (3) long-lived canopy species show greater increases in crown breadth with increasing height than do short-lived species. Trunk allometry is related to mechanical requirements for support, including the need to withstand greater wind forces in the upper canopy. The common canopy species, Pentaclethra macroloba, which comprises 40\% of the basal area at La Selva, is particularly wide-crowned and thick-trunked at its maximum height. On the other hand, the comparatively narrower crowns and trunks of the other canopy species allow them to reach a given height with less biomass.

	abstract = {1. A comparative study has been made of the allometric relationships among below-ground and above-ground dimensions of seedlings (6.5-27 cm tall) of 14 abundant shade-tolerant species taken from the forest floor in a warm-temperate rain forest on Yakushima Island, southern Japan. 2. The allometric lines between below-ground dimensions are significantly different between species, which reflects the differentiation between the species developing tap-roots and those developing horizontal fine roots in the same forest. The difference correlates with a difference in seed size, but not with height at maturity or habitat (ridge vs slope or gully). It is hypothesized that the differences in root architecture are related to 'choices' in microsite for establishment, the large-seeded tap-rooted species being better suited to soft soil and deep litter, and the small-seeded lateral rooters to rocky soil and a lack of litter. 3. The allometric relationship relating below- and above-ground dry mass is not sufficient to characterize a species' architecture; a species may have a large ratio of root mass to shoot mass but a low ratio of fine-root length to leaf area. 4. Interspecific differentiation in below-ground allometries at the seedling stage is not correlated with that in above-ground allometries at the seedling stage or with that in above-ground allometries at the sapling stage with developed branching architecture. Allometric 'design' in architecture at the sapling stage (related to earlier or later canopy-gap formation) is variously combined with that at the seedling stage (related to the microsite of establishment).},

Detected interspecific differences could be interpreted as a result of a trade-off between height growth (for future exploitation of better-lit conditions at higher levels in the canopy) and leaf area extension (for current exploitation of poor light nearer the base of the canopy). Saplings of emergent Swintonia schwenkii Teijsm. \& Binn. ex Hook. f. favoured height growth rather than expansion of assimilative area. Trends of interspecific differences in sapling allometry in tropical rain forest were similar to those in warm-temperate rain forest. Tropical saplings had more slender trunks and greater total leaf area at a given height than warm-temperate saplings, but dry weight proportions among organs were similar.

	abstract = {Stand age is an important structural determinant of canopy transpiration (Ec) and carbon gain. Another more functional parameter of forest structure is the leaf area/sapwood area relationship, {AL/AS}, which changes with site conditions and has been used to estimate leaf area index of forest canopies. The interpretation of age-related changes in {AL/AS} and the question of how {AL/AS} is related to forest functions are of current interest because they may help to explain forest canopy fluxes and growth. We conducted studies in mature stands of Picea abies (L.) Karst. varying in age from 40 to 140 years, in tree density from 1680 to 320 trees ha−1, and in tree height from 15 to 30 m. Structural parameters were measured by biomass harvests of individual trees and stand biometry. We estimated Ec from scaled-up xylem sap flux of trees, and canopy-level fluxes were predicted by a three-dimensional microclimate and gas exchange model ({STANDFLUX).} In contrast to pine species, {AL/AS} of P. abies increased with stand age from 0.26 to 0.48 m2 cm−2. Agreement between Ec derived from scaled-up sap flux and modeled canopy transpiration was obtained with the same parameterization of needle physiology independent of stand age. Reduced light interception per leaf area and, as a consequence, reductions in net canopy photosynthesis (Ac), canopy conductance (gc) and Ec were predicted by the model in the older stands. Seasonal water-use efficiency ({WUE} = {Ac/Ec)}, derived from scaled-up sap flux and stem growth as well as from model simulation, declined with increasing {AL/AS} and stand age. Based on the different behavior of age-related {AL/AS} in Norway spruce stands compared with other tree species, we conclude that {WUE} rather than {AL/AS} could represent a common age-related property of all species. We also conclude that, in addition to hydraulic limitations reducing carbon gain in old stands, a functional change in {AL/AS} that is related to reduced light interception per leaf area provides another potential explanation for reduced carbon gain in old stands of P. abies, even when hydraulic constraints increase in response to changes in canopy architecture and aging.},

	abstract = {The leaf area index ({LAI)} of fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations is highly dynamic both seasonally and inter-annually, and is spatially variable depending on pedo-climatic conditions. {LAI} is very important in determining the carbon and water balance of a stand, but is difficult to measure during a complete stand rotation and at large scales. Remote-sensing methods allowing the retrieval of {LAI} time series with accuracy and precision are therefore necessary. Here, we tested two methods for {LAI} estimation from {MODIS} 250m resolution red and near-infrared ({NIR)} reflectance time series. The first method involved the inversion of a coupled model of leaf reflectance and transmittance ({PROSPECT4)}, soil reflectance ({SOILSPECT)} and canopy radiative transfer ({4SAIL2).} Model parameters other than the {LAI} were either fixed to measured constant values, or allowed to vary seasonally and/or with stand age according to trends observed in field measurements. The {LAI} was assumed to vary throughout the rotation following a series of alternately increasing and decreasing sigmoid curves. The parameters of each sigmoid curve that allowed the best fit of simulated canopy reflectance to {MODIS} red and {NIR} reflectance data were obtained by minimization techniques. The second method was based on a linear relationship between the {LAI} and values of the {GEneralized} Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index ({GESAVI)}, which was calibrated using destructive {LAI} measurements made at two seasons, on Eucalyptus stands of different ages and productivity levels. The ability of each approach to reproduce field-measured {LAI} values was assessed, and uncertainty on results and parameter sensitivities were examined. Both methods offered a good fit between measured and estimated {LAI} (R2\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.80 and R2\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.62 for model inversion and {GESAVI-based} methods, respectively), but the {GESAVI-based} method overestimated the {LAI} at young ages.},

	abstract = {Aim  Trees are often observed to get shorter and more narrowly crowned in dry regions and at high elevations. We explore how this pattern is driven by two opposing factors: competition for light makes it advantageous to extend branches to their biomechanical limit, whereas under cold or arid conditions it is advantageous to have shorter branches, thereby reducing the length of the hydraulic transport system and embolism risk. Using data from 700,000 trees of 26 species, we quantify how environmental conditions influence the scaling of height and crown diameter ({CD)} with stem diameter (d.b.h.). We compare our predictions with those of metabolic scaling theory ({MST)}, which suggests that allometry is invariant of environment.
Location  48,000 inventory plots that systematically sample mainland Spain, a region in which climate varies strongly.
Methods  We fit d.b.h.–height and {d.b.h.–CD} functions using Bayesian methods, allowing comparison of within- and across-species trends in allometry along gradients of temperature, precipitation, drought and competition for light (i.e. the basal area of taller trees).
Results  The competitive environment had a strong influence on aboveground allometry, but all trees were far shorter than predicted by biomechanical models, suggesting that factors other than biomechanics are important. Species that dominate in arid and cold habitats were much shorter (for a given diameter) than those from benign conditions; but within-species heights did not vary strongly across climatic gradients.
Main conclusions  Our results do not support the {MST} prediction that d.b.h.–height and {d.b.h.–CD} allometries are invariant, or that biomechanical constraints determine height allometry. Rather, we highlight the role of hydraulic limitations in this region. The fact that intra-specific adjustment in {d.b.h.–CD} – height allometry along environmental gradients was far weaker than across-species changes may indicate genetic constraints on allometry which might contribute to niche differentiation among species.},

	abstract = {{1Interspecific} variation in leaf life span of woody plants should have important consequences for ontogenetic variation in biomass distribution, and hence carbon balance, in low light. This proposal was examined by measuring foliage turnover, growth, biomass allocation and biomass distribution of juveniles (25–1180 mm tall) of four evergreens differing in shade tolerance, growing in low light (2–5\% canopy openness) in temperate rainforest understoreys in south-central {Chile.2As} predicted, ontogenetic trends in leaf area ratio ({LAR)} of two very shade-tolerant species with long-lived leaves (Aextoxicon punctatum and Myrceugenia planipes) contrasted strongly with those of mid-tolerant Eucryphia cordifolia and intolerant Aristotelia chilensis. Low-light {LAR} fell rapidly with increasing plant size in Eucryphia and Aristotelia, but was size-invariant in the two shade-tolerant taxa. As a result, although small seedlings of Eucryphia and Aristotelia displayed more leaf area than shade-tolerant seedlings of similar size (largely because of differences in specific leaf area), this relationship was reversed for plants over ≈500 mm {tall.3Although} the slower foliage turnover of the shade-tolerant species at least partly explains this reversal, allocational differences may also be involved. Root mass fraction of both shade-tolerant species was significantly negatively correlated with size, possibly reflecting declining allocation to roots in larger plants. In contrast, root mass fraction was not correlated with size in Eucryphia or {Aristotelia.4Above-ground} relative growth rate in low light followed similar ontogenetic trends to {LAR}, declining more quickly in light-demanding species than in shade-tolerant associates. As a result, large seedlings ({\textgreater}400 mm tall) of shade-tolerant Myrceugenia and Aextoxicon grew more quickly than their light-demanding associates at the same height. The steeply declining {LAR} and growth of Eucryphia and Aristotelia suggest that these taxa will eventually die of energy starvation in low {light.5Results} are consistent with the idea that accumulation of an extensive leaf area eventually gives juvenile shade-tolerant evergreens a net carbon gain advantage over their light-demanding associates in low light. Awareness of long-term ontogenetic trends will enhance understanding of relationships of shade-tolerance variation with morphology and growth of woody evergreens.},

	abstract = {•	Background and aims The contemporary relegation of conifers mainly to cold or infertile sites has been ascribed to low competitive ability, as a result of the hydraulic inefficiency of tracheids and their seedlings’ initial dependence on small foliage areas. We tested the hypothesis that, in temperate rainforests, the larger leaves of angiosperms also reduce self-shading and thus enable display of larger effective foliage areas than the numerous small leaves of conifers. 
•	Methods We tested this hypothesis using {YPLANT} and structural equation modelling to compare self-shading and light interception potential of seedlings of six conifers and 12 angiosperm trees from temperate rainforests. The ratio of displayed leaf area to plant mass ({LARd)} was used to indicate plant light interception potential: {LARd} is the product of specific leaf area, leaf mass fraction, self-shading and leaf angle.
•	Results Angiosperm seedlings self-shaded less than conifers, mainly because of differences in leaf number (more than leaf size), and on average their {LARd} was about twice that of conifers. Although specific leaf area was the most pervasive influence on {LARd}, differences in self-shading also contributed significantly in large seedlings.
•	Conclusions The ability to deploy foliage in relatively few, large leaves is advantageous in minimizing self-shading, and enhancing seedling light interception potential per unit of plant biomass. This study adds significantly to evidence that vegetative traits may be at least as important as reproductive innovations in explaining the success of angiosperms in productive environments where vegetation is structured by light competition.},

	abstract = {Most knowledge of the physiological correlates of interspecific variation in shade tolerance derives from studies of first-year seedlings in artificial environments. The present study relates growth, allocation, foliage turnover, biomass distribution and gas exchange traits to low-light survival of large seedlings (20-100 cm tall) of eight temperate rainforest evergreens under field conditions. Taxa for which natural mortality was not observed in low light during the 14-month study are referred to here as "shade-tolerant" species, and those which did die in the shade are referred to as "light-demanding" species. In low light (2-5\% canopy openness), shade-tolerant species had slightly lower light compensation points than light-demanders. Light-demanding species had more plastic aboveground allocation patterns, generally allocating proportionally less aboveground biomass to foliage production than shade-tolerant associates in high light ({\textgreater}10\% canopy openness), but more in low light. Foliage turnover was generally much slower in shade-tolerant species (10-40\% year-1) than in light-demanding species (30-190\%). As these differences in leaf retention outweighed variation in allocation, shade-tolerant species displayed higher leaf areas at all light levels. Furthermore, all shade-tolerant species gained leaf area in low light during the study period, whereas light-demanding taxa showed leaf area declines. Higher leaf area ratios, plus differences in light compensation points, indicate that large seedlings of shade-tolerant evergreens enjoy net carbon gain advantages over light-demanding associates in low light. However, minimal growth rate differences in low light imply higher storage allocation in shade-tolerant species. This study provides a rather different picture from that which has emerged from recent reviews of first-year seedling data, illustrating the longterm consequences of foliage turnover differences for biomass distribution, and suggesting that shade tolerance in juvenile evergreen trees is associated with a suite of traits which enhance net carbon gain, but not growth, in low light. Accumulation of a large foliage area through long leaf retention times is probably a key mechanism enhancing low-light carbon gain in evergreens.},

Sapwood areas were interpolated or extrapolated to crown base with a sapwood taper function. Various transformations of crown length and crown radius (as well as crown base stem diameter as a surrogate for crown diameter) were assessed for their ability to predict crown base sapwood area. Regression analyses indicated that no single untransformed variable was a good predictor of sapwood area at crown base, but that combinations representing conic surface area performed quite well. Given the consistently strong relationship between total leaf area and sapwood area at crown base, conic surface area should accurately reflect total leaf area and relative photosynthetic potential of the tree. Gross crown dimensions and crown base sapwood area prove complementary in a forest modeling context, owing to the structural appeal of the former and the physiological appeal of the latter.},

Ring-porous species had the greatest network conductance and this value increased isometrically with trunk basal area, indicating that conductance per unit sapwood was independent of tree size.

	abstract = {The leaf area to sapwood area ratio ({Al:As)} of trees has been hypothesized to decrease as trees become older and taller. Theory suggests that {Al:As} must decrease to maintain leaf-specific hydraulic sufficiency as path length, gravity, and tortuosity constrain whole-plant hydraulic conductance. We tested the hypothesis that {Al:As} declines with tree height. Whole-tree {Al:As} was measured on 15 individuals of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) ranging in height from 13 to 62 m (aged 20-450 years). {Al:As} declined substantially as height increased (P=0.02). Our test of the hypothesis that {Al:As} declines with tree height was extended using a combination of original and published data on nine species across a range of maximum heights and climates. Meta-analysis of 13 whole-tree studies revealed a consistent and significant reduction in {Al:As} with increasing height (P{\textless}0.05). However, two species (Picea abies and Abies balsamea) exhibited an increase in {Al:As} with height, although the reason for this is not clear. The slope of the relationship between {Al:As} and tree height ({DELTAAl:As/DELTAh)} was unrelated to mean annual precipitation. Maximum potential height was positively correlated with {DELTAAl:As/DELTAh.} The decrease in {Al:As} with increasing tree size that we observed in the majority of species may be a homeostatic mechanism that partially compensates for decreased hydraulic conductance as trees grow in height.},

	abstract = {The generation of equations of biomass is important because they allow to evaluate the structure and condition of a forest, quantify its productivity, determine the amount of fixed carbon, the fixation rate of {CO2}, and thus valuate the impact on the mitigation of greenhouse gases. The objective of the present study was to fit allometric equations to quantify the accumulation of biomass (B), carbon (C), and carbon equivalent ({CO2e)} in a mixed plantation of 12 years of age of Pinus devoniana Lindl. and Pinus pseudostrobus Lindl., in Jerécuaro, state of Guanajuato, México. The biomass of each tree, leaves plus branches (Bhr), stem (Bf ) and total (Bt) was calculated using the ratio between dry weight and fresh weight, in 20 trees of each species. Through stem analyses and the Schumacher model the rate of annual increment of B, C and {CO2e} was obtained. Results indicate that the allometric equations efficiently quantify the components of biomass, especially of Bf (R2{\textgreater}0.85) in P. pseudostrobus, this species showing the highest increments in aboveground biomass. The total aboveground biomass, of 60.2 and 58.4 \% was registered in the stem; 39.8 and 41.6 \% in the leaves and branches of P. devoniana and P. pseudostrobus. Values calculated were 39.36 t B ha-1, 19.68 t C ha-1 and 72.02 t {CO2e} ha-1, after 12 years of the establishment of the plantation. According to the Schumacher model, the maximum productivity of aboveground biomass (Bf and Bhr) is reached at 20 years of age, which represents 3.96, 1.98 and 7.27 t ha-1 year-1 of B, C and {CO2e.}},

Baker, sapwood area (As) to foliage area (Af) ratios ({As:Af)} decreased as tree height increased, contradicting the common interpretation of the Pipe Model Theory as well as the generally observed trend of increasing {As:Af} ratios with tree height. To clarify this relationship, we estimated sapwood hydraulic conductivity theoretically based on measurements of sapwood vessel diameters and Poiseuille's law for fluid flow through pipes. Despite the observed decrease in {As:Af} ratios with tree height, leaf specific conductivity increased with total tree height, largely as a result of an increase in the specific conductivity of sapwood. This observation supports the proposition that the stem's ability to supply foliage with water must increase as trees grow taller, to compensate for the increased hydraulic path length. The results presented here highlight the importance of measuring sapwood hydraulic conductivity in analyses of sapwood–foliage interactions, and suggest that measurements of sapwood hydraulic conductivity may help to resolve conflicting observations of how {As:Af} ratios change as trees grow taller.},

The shape parameter ranged from 1.73 to 3.23 and gradually increased up to an asymptotic value with an increase of stem diameter at breast height. The scale parameter of the distribution ranged from 1.0 to 4.2 and tended to increase in proportion to stem diameter at breast height. Foliage area of a tree correlated well with stem diameter at breast height through an ordinary allometric equation. Tree height could be approximated fairly well by a generalized allometric equation as a function of stem diameter at breast height. On the basis of the census of stem diameter at breast height, canopy profile could be constructed synthesizing crown profiles of foliage area for individual trees in the stand.

dominance categories ({ANCOVA}, P {\textless} 0.10). For a representative size (15 cm {DBH)}, dominant trees allocated 63.4, 
13.2, 11.3, and 12.0\% of biomass to bole, branch, needle, and root tissue compared with 75.9, 6.7, 5.6, and 11.7\% for 
suppressed trees. At any given {DBH}, suppressed trees were also taller than dominant trees and had a greater porportion 
of heterotrophic (bole plus branch plus root mass) to autotrophic (needle mass) tissue. Percent carbon and nitrogen of 
tissues did not differ between dominance categories. Unlike the increased investment in leaf area observed for 
seedlings and saplings of shade-tolerant species, suppressed loblolly pine increased allocation to bole mass and height 
growth. An increase in height for this shade-intolerant species may enable some suppressed individuals to escape 
competition for light. However, increased allocation to heterotrophic versus autotrophic tissue in suppressed trees may 
confer a cumulative disadvantage over time because of increased respiratory load.},

Species-specific and mixed-species regressions for estimating total above-ground dry weight ({DW)} were therefore developed using eight abundant secondary forest tree species in the central Amazon. Using only {DBH} as the input variable, the species-specific equations estimated {DW} of individual trees with an average error of 10–15\%. For the mixed-species equations, developed using 132 trees from seven of the eight species (excluding Cecropia), average error in estimating {DW} of individual trees was 19.8\% using only {DBH} and 15.0\% using {DBH} plus specific density of the wood ({SD).} Average {SD} for each species can be substituted without increasing the error of the estimate. Adding total tree height (H) as an input variable provided only a slight reduction in error to 14.0\%. Previously published mixed-species biomass regression models, based on primary and secondary forest trees of the Amazon, were also cross-validated against the trees of this study. Two of these models, based on primary forest plots and using only {DBH} as an input, overestimated biomass by 10–60\% for central Amazonian secondary forest trees in the size range 5–25\&\#xa0;cm. The overestimate was greatest for the larger trees. Including Cecropia in the test group will make the overestimate even greater. Those published equations using {DBH}, H and {SD} as inputs, whether from secondary or primary forest plots, showed better agreement with the sample-derived regressions and lower average errors in estimation of individual tree dry weights.},

	abstract = {Growth and biomass partitioning across a natural light gradient were examined in saplings (0.3-2.6 m in height) of relatively shade-tolerant Acer platanoides L. and relatively intolerant Quercus robur L. for dependence on relative irradiance, calculated from hemispherical photographs ({RI)}, and on total tree height (H). H and {RI} were independent. All allometric relationships between H and the parameters of plant biomass and dimensions were positively affected by {RI}, signifying that at a common H, saplings increased horizontal growth relative to vertical growth in environments with greater irradiance. Root mass ratio (coarse plus fine roots per total plant biomass) increased with increasing irradiance in both species and was not different between the species. However, Q. robur had a larger stem mass ratio, while A. platanoides had a greater leaf mass ratio ({LMR).} At a common irradiance, leaf mass per area ({LMA)} was lower in A. platanoides. As a result of these interspecific differences in fractional allocation of sapling biomass in foliage and biomass requirement for construction of foliar surface area, leaf area ratio ({LAR} = {LMR/LMA)} was larger in A. platanoides. Relative growth rate of standing biomass ({RGR)} was significantly correlated with {RI} in both species and was not different between the species. In contrast, net assimilation rate per unit leaf area ({NAR)} was larger in Q. robur. Thus, in these species a similar {RGR} ({NAR} x {LAR)} was achieved in a completely different way: A platanoides increased the intercepting foliar area, while Q. robur increased the productivity per unit area. Growth analysis repeated on a nitrogen basis demonstrated that nitrogen use efficiency (biomass increment per unit nitrogen) was similar between the species, and that the species differences in {NAR} resulted from different foliar N concentrations; fractional nitrogen investment in foliage was independent of species, but lower nitrogen cost of leaves allowed A. platanoides to construct a more extensive foliar display with the same nitrogen investment in foliage. Biomass allocation between different compartments was also dependent on sapling size. With increasing H, A. platanoides maintained a constant proportion of biomass in foliage, but the relative amount of foliage decreased in Q. robur. Therefore, due to a decreasing investment of resources in foliage construction with advancing sapling ontogeny, saplings of similar height require more light to survive in Q. robur than in A. platanoides. Greater investment of biomass in leaves vs. standing biomass may result in lower volume gain and reduced competitive ability in more open habitats in A. platanoides. These results indicate that interspecific differences in allometry and nitrogen allocation patterns significantly alter species competitive relations during sapling development across the gap-understory continuum.},

Both individual tree-based models and other forest process-based models are generally highly sensitive to this parameter, but information on its temporal or within-stand variability is still scarce. In a 2–4-year-old Eucalyptus plantation in Congo, prone to seasonal drought, the within-stand and seasonal variability in {SLA} were investigated by means of destructive sampling carried out at 2-month intervals, over a 2-year period. Within-crown vertical gradients of {SLA} were small. Highly significant relationships were found between tree-average {SLA} ({SLAt)} and tree size (tree height, Ht, or diameter at breast height, {DBH):} {SLAt} ranged from about 9\&\#xa0;m2\&\#xa0;kg−1 for dominant trees to about 14–15\&\#xa0;m2\&\#xa0;kg−1 for the smallest trees. The decrease in {SLAt} with increasing tree size was accurately predicted from {DBH} using power functions. Stand-average {SLA} varied by about 20\% during the year, with lowest values at the end of the 5-month dry season, and highest values about 2–3 months after the onset of the wet season. Variability in leaf water status according to tree size and season is discussed as a possible determinant of both the within-stand and seasonal variations in {SLA.}},

	abstract = {Australian savannas exhibit marked seasonality in precipitation, with more than 90\% of the annual total falling between October and May. The dry season is characterized by declining soil water availability and high vapor pressure deficits (up to 2.5 {kPa).} We used heat pulse technology to measure whole-tree transpiration rates on a daily and seasonal basis for the two dominant eucalypts at a site near Darwin, Australia. Contrary to expectations, transpiration rates were higher during the dry season than during the wet season, largely because of increased evaporative demand and the exploitation of groundwater reserves by the trees. Transpiration rates exhibited a marked hysteresis in relation to vapor pressure deficit, which was more marked in the dry season than in the wet season. This result may be attributable to low soil hydraulic conductivity, or the use of stored stem water, or both. Tree water use was strongly correlated with leaf area and diameter at breast height and there were no differences in transpiration between the species studied. These results are discussed in relation to scaling tree water use to stand water use. [References: 37]},

The mean values showed asymptotic growth, maintaining a near-constant level after a stand age of 9 years. Peak values were found at 9 years, followed by a slight decrease because of a continuous reduction in stand density. This temporal trend suggests that the leaf biomass per unit land area attains a peak at an age of 9 years. As the stand density changes with stand age, the relationship between stand stem cross-sectional area at the crown base and stand density showed an optimum curve in which the optimum density was around 9200 ha −1 . We propose hypothetical trends in primary productivity and biomass density with stand age, based on the results of measurements of stem cross-sectional area at the crown base and stand density under the assumption of the 3/2 power law of self-thinning.},

In addition, branched trees had crowns of greater depth, and crown area increased more rapidly with increasing height in branched trees as compared with unbranched trees. In contrast, biomass distribution to nonphotosynthetic and photosynthetic organs changed only with tree size and was similar in unbranched and branched trees of similar size. Light capture efficiency was related to neither height nor branching status for trees with heights of 1–2.5 m. Coexistence of unbranched and branched trees at the height around the onset of branching is possible because these trees realize similar biomass distribution patterns and light capture efficiencies. Individual leaf area and leaf area index increased with tree size in unbranched trees but decreased with tree size in branched trees. These results suggest that several leaf clusters of limited size are sparsely arranged in a large three-dimensional space in tall trees. (English) [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}
L’auteur a étudié l’architecture du houppier et les patrons de distribution de la biomasse en relation avec la ramification et la dimension des arbres, chez une espèce pionnière, le Rhus trichocarpa Miq. (Anacardiaceae), dans une forêt secondaire du Japon. L’architecture du houppier se modifie selon la grosseur de l’arbre et la ramification. La profondeur du houppier et sa superficie sont plus importantes chez les grands arbres. De plus, les arbres ramifiés ont des houppiers plus profonds, et la surface des houppiers augmente plus rapidement avec l’accroissement en hauteur chez les arbres ramifiés, comparativement aux arbres non-ramifiés. Au contraire, la distribution de la biomasse aux organes photosynthétiques et non- photosynthétiques change seulement selon la dimension de l’arbre, et est semblable chez les arbres ramifiés ou non-ramifiés de même dimension. L’efficacité de la réception de la lumière est reliée ni à la hauteur ni à l’état de la ramification, chez les arbres de 1–1,25 m de haut. La co-existence d’arbres ramifiés et non-ramifiés, environ à la hauteur où débutent les branches, pourrait être possible parce que ces arbres génèrent un patron de distribution similaire de la biomasse et d’efficacité de la réception de la lumière. La surface des feuilles individuelles et l’index de surface foliaire augmentent avec la grosseur de l’arbre, chez les arbres non-ramifiés, mais diminue avec la grosseur chez les arbres ramifiés.

	abstract = {We estimated crown characteristics, such as median crown height, leaf fall rate and leaf biomass, from litter leaves for a Malaysian canopy species, Elateriospermum tapos. Leaf morphology was compared between the harvested and litter leaves for trees of various heights. Also, litter traps were set systematically around the trees of various heights, and distribution patterns were investigated for litter leaves. Leaf area and dry weight decreased with increasing height in a similar manner in both leaf litter and harvested leaves. This suggests that median crown height can be estimated from mean area or mass of the leaf litter of a tree in this species. Furthermore, horizontal distribution patterns of litter leaves were well explained by the Gaussian kernel. Leaf fall rate was estimated to be 2.0–28.1\&\#xa0;kg per tree per year in the five trees of various heights, and was greater in taller trees. Since leaf life span was smaller for taller trees, leaf biomass was estimated to be 2.6–30.5\&\#xa0;kg per tree, and was also greater in taller trees. These estimated values are similar to the values estimated from the allometric equation that uses the diameter at breast height and overall tree height as parameters.},

	abstract = {In rainforests, trunk size, strength, crown position, and geometry of a tree affect light interception and the likelihood of mechanical failure. Allometric relationships of tree diameter, wood density, and crown architecture vs. height are described for a diverse range of rainforest trees in Brunei, northern Borneo. The understory species follow a geometric model in their diameter-height relationship (slope, \{beta\} = 1.08), while the stress-elasticity models prevail (\{beta\} = 1.27-1.61) for the midcanopy and canopy/emergent species. These relationships changed with ontogeny, especially for the understory species. Within species, the tree stability safety factor ({SSF)} and relative crown width decreased exponentially with increasing tree height. These trends failed to emerge in across-species comparisons and were reversed at a common (low) height. Across species, the relative crown depth decreased with maximum potential height and was indistinguishable at a common (low) height. Crown architectural traits influence {SSF} more than structural property of wood density. These findings emphasize the importance of applying a common reference size in comparative studies and suggest that forest trees (especially the understory group) may adapt to low light by having deeper rather than wider crowns due to an efficient distribution and geometry of their foliage.},

	abstract = {The crown architectures of 11 Psychotria species native to Barro Colorado Island, Panama were reconstructed from field measurements of leaf and branch geometry with the three-dimensional simulation model Y-plant. The objective was to assess the role of species differences in architecture in light capture and carbon gain in their natural understory environment. When species were grouped according to their putative light environment preference, the shade tolerant species were found to have a small but significantly higher efficiency of light capture for both diffuse and direct light as compared to the light demanding species. Within each grouping, however, there were few significant differences in light capture efficiency among species. The lower efficiencies of light demanding species was due to slightly higher self-shading and slightly lower angular efficiencies. Simulations of whole plant assimilation showed that light demanding species had greater daily assimilation in both direct and diffuse light due to the significantly greater light availability in the sites where light demanding species were found, as compared to those where shade tolerant species occurred. Among light demanding species, the above ground relative growth rate measured over a 1-year period by applying allometric equations for mass versus linear dimensions, was positively correlated with diffuse {PFD} and with mean daily assimilation estimated from Y-plant. For the shade tolerant plants, there was no significant correlation between {RGR} and mean daily assimilation or with any measure of light availability, probably because they occurred over a much narrower range of light environments. Overall, the results reveal a strong convergence in light capture efficiencies among the Psychotria species at lower values than previously observed in understory plants using similar approaches. Constraints imposed by other crown functions such as hydraulics and biomechanical support may place upper limits on light capture efficiency.},

Under low light conditions, maple and ash showed a slight lead in recent annual length increment compared with beech. With increasing light, ash and maple constantly gained superiority in length increment, whereas beech approached an asymptotic value above 35\% light. A suite of architectural and leaf morphological attributes indicated a more pronounced ability of beech to adapt to shade than ash and maple. Beech displayed its leaves along the entire tree height (with a concentration in the middle crown), yielding a higher live crown ratio than ash and maple. It allocated biomass preferentially to radial growth which resulted in low height to diameter ratios, and expressed marked plagiotropic growth in shade indicating a horizontal light-foraging strategy. In addition, beech exhibited the highest specific leaf area, a greater total leaf area per unit tree height, a slightly greater leaf area index, and a greater plasticity to light in total leaf area. Ash and maple presented a “gap species” growth strategy, characterized by a marked and constant response in growth rates to increasing light and an inability to strongly reduce their growth rates in deep shade. In shade, they showed some plasticity in displaying most of their leaf area at the top of the crown to minimize self-shading and to enhance light interception. Through this, particularly, maple developed an “umbrella” like crown. These species-specific responses may be used for controlling the development of mixed-species regeneration in shelterwood systems.},

	abstract = {1. Growth of seedlings of 15 rain-forest tree species was compared under controlled conditions, at six different light levels (3, 6, 12, 25, 50 and 100\% daylight). 2. Most plant variables showed strong ontogenetic changes; they were highly dependent on the biomass of the plant. 3. Growth rate was highest at intermediate fight levels (25-50\%) above which it declined. Most plant variables showed a curvilinear response to irradiance, with the largest changes at the lowest Light levels. 4. There was a consistent ranking in growth between species; species that were fast growing in a low-light environment were also fast growing in a high-light environment. 5. At low light, interspecific variation in relative growth rate was determined mainly by differences in a morphological trait, the leaf area ratio ({LAR)}, whereas at high light it was determined mainly by differences in a physiological trait, the net assimilation rate ({NAR).} 6. {NAR} became a stronger determinant of growth than {LAR} in more than 10-15\% daylight. As light availability in the forest is generally much lower than this threshold level, it follows that interspecific variation in growth in a forest environment is mainly owing to variation in morphology.

	volume = {87},
	abstract = {Tree architecture is an important determinant of the height extension, light capture, and mechanical stability of trees, and it allows species to exploit the vertical height gradient in the forest canopy and horizontal light gradients at the forest floor. Tropical tree species partition these gradients through variation in adult stature (Hmax) and light demand. In this study we compare 22 architectural traits for 54 Bolivian moist-forest tree species. We evaluate how architectural traits related to Hmax vary with tree size, and we present a conceptual scheme in which we combine the two axes into four different functional groups. Interspecific correlations between architecture and Hmax varied strongly from negative to positive, depending on the reference sizes used. Stem height was positively related to Hmax at larger reference diameters (14–80 cm). Species height vs. diameter curves often flattened toward their upper ends in association with reproductive maturity for species of all sizes. Thus, adult understory trees were typically shorter than similar-diameter juveniles of larger species. Crown area was negatively correlated with Hmax at small reference heights and positively correlated at larger reference heights (15–34 m). Wide crowns allow the small understory species to intercept light over a large area at the expense of a reduced height growth. Crown length was negatively correlated with Hmax at intermediate reference heights (4–14 m). A long crown enables small understory species to maximize light interception in a light-limited environment. Light-demanding species were characterized by orthotropic stems and branches, large leaves, and a monolayer leaf arrangement. They realized an efficient height growth through the formation of narrow and shallow crowns. Light demand turned out to be a much stronger predictor of tree architecture than Hmax, probably because of the relatively low, open, and semi-evergreen canopy at the research site. The existence of four functional groups (shade-tolerant, partial-shade-tolerant, and long- and short-lived pioneer) was confirmed by the principal component and discriminant analysis. Both light demand and Hmax capture the major variation in functional traits found among tropical rain forest tree species, and the two-way classification scheme provides a straightforward model to understand niche differentiation in tropical forests.},

Plants of different pruning types differed in trunk height (43 versus 29 cm) and primary branches total length (171 versus 310 cm). The two pruning types had effects on dry mass formation and leaf area projection ({LAP)} during the vegetation period. Trees which had a shorter trunk and longer lateral branches produced more biomass and had a higher {LAP.} Total dry mass formation varied from 489 to 912 g m−2 and {LAP} from 3.26 to 7.37. Total aboveground biomass increased from 2.3 ± 0.5 to 4.89 ± 1.4 kg tree−1 and from 4.6 ± 1.8 to 8.9 ± 1.0 kg tree−1 for the pruning types with shorter and longer lateral branches, respectively. Growth of twigs and leaves was positively correlated with total length of branches. Relative dry mass allocation to branches, twigs and leaves, length of twigs per cm of branches and specific leaf area (13.57 ± 0.72 m2 kg−1) were not affected by pruning and water supply. Trees with shorter branches had higher {LAD.} Results indicate that pruning type should be considered as a management tool to optimize biomass production. Detailed studies on effects of canopy size and shape on radiation interception and growth are required to improve the productivity of jatropha.},

Nevertheless, little is known about their biomass production and partitioning and their potential in terms of carbon sequestration. If above-ground biomass ({AGB)} can be estimated based on established allometric relations, below-ground ({BGB)} estimates are much less common. The aim of this work was to develop allometric equations to estimate biomass of these plantations, mainly for the root components. Data from 9 Eucalyptus robusta stands (47–87 years of plantation age, 3–5 years of coppice-shoot age) were collected and analyzed. Biomass of 3 sampled trees per stand was determined destructively. Dry weight of {AGB} components (leaves, branches and stems) were estimated as a function of basal area of all shoots per stump and dry weight for {BGB} components (mainly stump, coarse root ({CR)} and medium root ({MR))} were estimated as a function of stump circumference. Biomass was then computed using allometric equations from stand inventory data. Stand biomass ranged from 102 to 130 Mg ha−1 with more than 77\% contained in the {BGB} components. The highest dry weight was allocated in the stump and in the {CR} (51\% and 42\% respectively) for {BGB} parts and in the stem (69\%) for {AGB} part. Allometric relationships developed herein could be applied to other Eucalyptus plantations which present similar stand density and growing conditions; anyhow, more is needed to be investigated in understanding biomass production and partitioning over time for this kind of forest ecosystem.},

The species differ widely in shade tolerance, seed size and leaf life span. 2, In low Light, all species allocated proportionally more biomass to stems and less to roots, but the same to foliage, compared with the high-light environment. At a common size, all species had finer leaf morphology (higher specific leaf area, {SLA)} but coarser root morphology (lower specific root length, {SRL)} in low than high light. From a whole plant perspective, all species enhanced leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio, {LAR)} in low light and root length per unit plant mass (root length ratio, {RLR)} in high light. 3, Shade-intolerant deciduous species had higher {RGR}, {SLA} and {SRL} than larger seeded evergreens: ranking from Populus, Betula and Larix spp., then to five evergreen Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp., which were generally comparable in these traits, there were no changes in growth rankings of species between high- and low-light environments, nor consistent differences among species in biomass partitioning. Hence, species differences in leaf and root morphology ({SLA;} {SRL)} drove whole plant patterns, such as Populus, Betula and Larix had greater total leaf area and root length per unit plant mass ({LAR} and {RLR}, respectively) than the evergreens. Interspecific variation in {RGR} in both high and low light was positively correlated (r approximate to 0.9) with {SLA}, {SRL}, {LAR} and {RLR}, and negatively correlated (r approximate to -0.9) to seed mass and leaf life span. 4. These data suggest that {SLA}, {SRL}, {NAR} and {RGR} are closely associated with variation in life-history traits and that variation in leaf and root structure more strongly influences patterns of {RGR} among species and light environments than does biomass partitioning.

	abstract = {Cerrado is a biome that occupies about 25\% of the Brazilian territory and is characterized by a gradient of grassland to savanna and forest formations and by high species richness. It has been severely affected by degradation and deforestation and has been heavily fragmented over the past 4–5 decades. Despite the recognized overall ecological importance of the Cerrado, there are only few studies focusing on the quantification of biomass in this biome. We conducted such a case study in the South-East of Brazil in a cerrado sensu stricto (cerrado s.s.) with the goal to produce estimates of above- and belowground biomass and to develop allometric equations. A number of 120 trees from 18 species were destructively sampled and partitioned into the components: leaves, branches and bole. Five models with {DBH} (D), height (H), {D2H} and wood density ({WD)} as independent variables were tested for the development of allometric models for individual tree aboveground biomass (leaves\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;branches\&\#xa0;+\&\#xa0;bole). One model based on basal area ({BA)} as a stand parameter was also tested as an alternative approach for predicting aboveground biomass in the stand level. Belowground biomass was estimated by subsampling on 10 sample plots. Mean aboveground tree biomass (bole, branches and leaves) was estimated to be 62,965.5\&\#xa0;kg\&\#xa0;ha−1({SE\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;14.6\%)} and belowground biomass accounted for 37,501.8\&\#xa0;kg\&\#xa0;ha−1 ({SE\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;23\%).} The best-fit equation for the estimation of individual tree aboveground biomass include {DBH} and wood density as explanatory variables (R2\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.898; {SEE\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.371)} and is applicable for the diameter range of this study (5.0–27.6\&\#xa0;cm) and in environments with similar conditions of the cerrado s.s. sampled. In the stand level, the model tested presented a higher goodness of fit than the single tree models (R2\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.934; {SEE\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.224).} Our estimates of aboveground biomass are higher than reported by other studies developed in the same physiognomy, but the estimates of belowground biomass are within the range of values reported in other studies from sites in cerrado s.s. Both biomass estimates, however, exhibit relatively large standard errors. The root-to-shoot ratio of the sample trees is in the magnitude of reported values for savanna ecosystems, but smaller than estimated from other studies in the cerrado s.s.},

A destructive harvest was implemented two growing seasons following litter application to evaluate treatment impacts on patterns of aboveground biomass allocation and to develop allometric functions enabling prediction of aboveground biomass components. We examined relative allocation to foliage, crown wood, and stemwood; and the proportion of current-year and second-year foliage in the upper vs. the lower crown. No treatment effects were observed in general allocation patterns between foliage, crown wood, and stemwood mass, although treatments did significantly increase the ratio of current-year to second-year foliage in the upper crown. Biomass allocation patterns within trees did vary with tree size. The ratio of foliage to woody biomass remained similar across the range of tree sizes examined; but within the woody component, the amount of crown wood relative to stemwood increased with tree size. The ratio of current-year to second-year foliage remained similar in the lower crown, but the proportion of second-year foliage in the upper crown increased with d.b.h. Statistically significant treatment differences were found in the allometric relationships for estimating stemwood, crown wood, and foliar biomass. In all cases, litter application treatments increased the slope of the relationship between the aboveground biomass component and tree size. Our results suggest that failure to account for treatment-related effects on tree allometry could result in estimation errors of 5-15 percent for individual aboveground biomass components.},

The analysis allowed us to conclude that foliage mass was not affected by the silvicultural treatment, tree size or competitive status. Fine root biomass showed an inverse relationship with fertilization. Growth efficiency was not affected by the management treatment, tree size, or intraspecific competition. The greater stem wood allocation recorded in the agroforestry treatment than in the forestry regime, is interpreted as a response to two different types of competition. Competition for light appears to induce growth in height and diameter as a function of local environment conditions. Competition for nutrients appears to reduce allocation to fine roots and increase allocation to stem wood.},

Models for estimating crown profile in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were developed from attributes of individual whorl branches, including basal diameter, total length, angle of origin, and height from ground. The prediction system consisted of four equations to predict whorl branch basal diameter, branch length, branch angle of origin, and corresponding crown radius. The system is entered with three standard individual tree measurements: diameter at breast height ({DBH)}, total height, and height to crown base. Four approaches were developed for modeling crown profile with this system of equations, distinguished by parameter estimation method, modeling data subset, and the specific form by which whorl branch diameter was represented (mean vs maximum diameter). A system-of-equations parameter-estimation technique (modified three-stage least squares) was applied to account for the correlation of error terms across the equations, and this procedure was compared with ordinary and nonlinear least squares methods. The resulting crown profile prediction systems were evaluated under both theoretical and empirical criteria. The recommended system appears to perform well against validation data on both an equation (branch) level and system (crown profile) level.},

Efficient operational deployment of genetic materials requires an understanding of possible site and silvicultural treatment interactions to maximize yield potential. We examined genotype (family) by environmental interactions ({G\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;E)} through age 5 years using a factorial experiment consisting of silvicultural treatment intensity (operational versus intensive), planting density (1334 versus 2990\&\#xa0;trees\&\#xa0;ha−1) and families (seven elite full-sib loblolly and six elite full-sib slash pine families). In January of 2000, randomized complete block, split-plot experiments were installed at two locations for each species in southeast Georgia and northeast Florida. Five years after planting, both loblolly and slash pine demonstrated significant interactions among several factors: genotype\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;location (p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.028 and p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.016, respectively), genotype\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;silvicultural treatment intensity (p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.055 and p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.059), and silvicultural treatment intensity\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;density (p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.002 and p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.001) for basal area ({BA)} and standing stem volume ({VOL).} Genotype\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;silvicultural treatment interactions were positive, with the best overall performing families responding the greatest to intensive treatment. There were changes in slash pine family rankings between locations, which were partly explained by reductions in growth associated with a combination of fusiform rust infection [Cronartium quercum (Berk.) Miyabe ex Shirai f. sp. fusiforme] and wind damage from the 2004 hurricane season. No three-way interactions, which included family, were evident and all genetic sources were stable across the contrasting planting densities. At age 5, loblolly pine outperformed slash pine (p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.0001), especially under the intensive silvicultural intensity. While loblolly performance was similar whether deployed in mixtures or pure family blocks, slash pine tended to be more productive in intimate mixtures than when grown in pure family blocks (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.0754 for aboveground biomass).},

	abstract = {Summary 1. The sun-shade acclimation and plasticity of 16 functional leaf traits of 38 tropical tree species were studied in relation to their light demand, maximum adult stature and ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. 2. Species differed significantly in all leaf traits, which explained a large part of the observed variation (average R2 = 0.72). Light had a significant effect on 12 traits and species showed a similar proportional response to light, indicating that the species ranking in trait performance is largely maintained in different light environments. 3. Specific leaf area, leaf nutrient content and chlorophyll : nitrogen ratio showed the largest plasticity to irradiance. These traits are important for maximizing growth in different light conditions because they are closely linked to the photosynthetic capacity and carbon balance of the plant. 4. Plasticity is generally thought to be greatest for pioneer species that occupy early successional habitats with a large variation in irradiance. This hypothesis was rejected because short-lived pioneers showed the lowest plasticity to irradiance. 5. An alternative hypothesis states that plasticity is largest for tall species that experience large ontogenetic changes in irradiance during their life cycle. Yet plasticity was barely related to adult stature or ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. Short-lived pioneers that experience consistently high light levels did have low plasticity, but shade-tolerant species that experience consistently low light levels had high plasticity. 6. Tropical rainforest species show a large variation in plasticity. Plasticity is a compromise between many factors and constraints, and all of these may explain the observed patterns to some extent.

	abstract = {The decline in aboveground wood production after canopy closure in even-aged forest stands is a common pattern in forests, but clear evidence for the mechanism causing the decline is lacking. The problem is fundamental to forest biology, commercial forestry (the decline sets the rotation age), and to carbon storage in forests. We tested three hypotheses about mechanisms causing the decline in wood growth by quantifying the complete carbon budget of developing stands for over six years (a full rotation) in replicated plantations of Eucalyptus saligna near Pepeekeo, Hawaii. Our first hypothesis was that gross primary production ({GPP)} does not decline with stand age, and that the decline in wood growth results from a shift in partitioning from wood production to respiration (as tree biomass accumulates), total belowground carbon allocation (as a result of declining soil nutrient supply), or some combination of these or other sinks. An alternative hypothesis was that {GPP} declines with stand age and that the decline in aboveground wood production is proportional to the decline in {GPP.} A decline in {GPP} could be driven by reduced canopy leaf area and photosynthetic capacity resulting from increasing nutrient limitation, increased abrasion between tree canopies, lower turgor pressure to drive foliar expansion, or hydraulic limitation of water flux as tree height increases. A final hypothesis was a combination of the first two: {GPP} declines, but the decline in wood production is disproportionately larger because partitioning shifts as well.

We measured the entire annual carbon budget (aboveground production and respiration, total belowground carbon allocation [{TBCA]}, and {GPP)} from 0.5 years after seedling planting through 6½ years (when trees were 25 m tall). The replicated plots included two densities of trees (1111 trees/ha and 10 000 trees/ha) to vary the ratio of canopy leaf mass to wood mass in the individual trees, and three fertilization regimes (minimal, intensive, and minimal followed by intensive after three years) to assess the role of nutrition in shaping the decline in {GPP} and aboveground wood production.

The forest closed its canopy in 1–2 years, with peak aboveground wood production, coinciding with canopy closure, of 1.2–1.8 kg C·m−2·yr−1. Aboveground wood production declined from 1.4 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 2 to 0.60 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 6. Hypothesis 1 failed: {GPP} declined from 5.0 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 2 to 3.2 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 6. Aboveground woody respiration declined from 0.66 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 2 to 0.22 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 6 and {TBCA} declined from 1.9 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 2 to 1.4 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 6. Our data supported hypothesis 3: the decline in aboveground wood production (42\% of peak) was proportionally greater than the decline in canopy photosynthesis (64\% of peak). The fraction of {GPP} partitioned to belowground allocation and foliar respiration increased with stand age and contributed to the decline in aboveground wood production. The decline in {GPP} was not caused by nutrient limitation, a decline in leaf area or in photosynthetic capacity, or (from a related study on the same site) by hydraulic limitation. Nutrition did interact with the decline in {GPP} and aboveground wood production, because treatments with high nutrient availability declined more slowly than did our control treatment, which was fertilized only during stand establishment.},

We analysed the relationships between vital rates (growth and survival) and four morphological traits ({SLA}, biomass allocation to stems, leaves and roots). We hypothesised that these traits represent differentiation axes in the way seedlings face the heterogeneous light regime typical of the {CF} understorey. For all species, traits between the different light levels, i.e. allocation to leaves, roots and stems differed among light levels. Five species had the largest {SLA} in the lowest light levels at the end of the experiment (Citharexylum, Dendropanax, Fraxinus, Quercus and Magnolia). Juglans was the only species with a large {SLA} at the highest light level (377.47\&\#xa0;cm2\&\#xa0;g−1). In contrast, light levels did not cause any significant variation in {SLA} of Persea and Simplococarpon at the end of the experiment. The relative height growth rates ({RHGR)} of the seedlings of five species were significantly different between light levels (P\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.05). Overall, all species grew better in the highest light levels. The {RHGR} of three species were correlated positively with {SLA.} In turn, allocation to stem, leaves and root biomass were strongly correlated with the {RHGR} of five species (e.g. Citharexylum, Dendropanax and Fraxinus). Survival did not vary significantly between treatments in any species, only in the case of Simplococarpon (P\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.05) and was correlated with all morphological variables. For this species, Peto and Peto's test showed a significantly larger survival of seedlings in the highest light level. The mean responses of these species based on all traits to the controlled light variation did not differed significantly. Our results show that these species display a wide range of resource allocation patterns when exposed to the varying light conditions that may be found in the forest understorey and highlight the role of morphological traits in this variation.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the above-ground biomass and nutrient pools in relation to soil properties and litter fall, have been performed in four Mediterranean oak forests of the Sierra de Gata Mountains, province of Salamanca, Spain, across a rainfall gradient. In order to establish biomass regression equations, the best fit was obtained by applying the allometric method {Y\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;aXb.} Nutrient concentrations (except Ca) were highest in the leaves, although the highest percentage was stored in the trunk owing to the elevated percentage of total above-ground mass (73\%). The leaves were found to accumulate a qualitatively important fraction of mobile nutrients as compared with their low percentage in total above-ground biomass (3\%). The soil organic contents comply with the rainfall factor, but this does not appear to affect the complete decomposition process decisively, since the limiting factor is soil moisture. The rainfall distribution is similar for all plots studied, the main differences essentially being seen in the amount of water received during the rainy season (in each case with sufficient moisture for nutrient release). Between the plots, the main difference was seen for P, which was retranslocated to a much greater extent at Navasfrı\&amp;\#x0301;as, where the availability of this nutrient in the soil is lower. The acidity of the parent material seemed to affect the potential turnover of N, P and K. Nutrient management seems to be related to the availability for the trees of elements such as phosphorus and potassium. Nutrients present in lower amounts are recycled through the plant–soil system in much higher proportions than other nutrients present in greater amounts in the soil. The parent material mostly affects the soil content of assimilable Ca and P, on the other hand, the climate (mostly rainfall) affects the organic matter content, total N, the cation exchange capacity and the percentage of base saturation of the soil epipedons of these forest ecosystems. The plots with the lowest fertility (those located on slates) have the lowest production of litter and the lowest decay rate. Their cycles are therefore slowed down with respect to those of plots located on granites (more fertile).},

We compared estimates of above ground tree biomass for four indigenous tree used on farm in the Philippines based on the {WanFBA} model tree architecture with data from destructive sampling. Allometric equations for the four species varied in the constant (biomass at virtual stem diameter 1) and power of the scaling rule ( b in Y = {aD} b ), deviating from the value of 8/3 that is claimed to be universal. Allometric equations for aboveground biomass were 0.035 D 2.87 for Shorea contorta , 0.133 D 2.36 for Vitex parviflora , 0.063 D 2.54 for Pterocarpus indicus and 0.065 D 2.28 for Artocarpus heterophyllus , respectively. Allometric equations for branch biomass had a higher b factor than those for total biomass (except in Artocarpus); allometric equations for the leave + twig fraction a lower b . The performance of the {WanFBA} model was significantly improved by introduction of a tapering factor “τ“ for decrease of branch diameter within a single link. All statistical tests performed on measured biomass versus biomass predicted from the {WanFBA} results confirm the viability of the {WanFBA} model as a non-destructive tool for predicting above-ground biomass equations for total biomass, branch biomass and the leaf + twig fraction.},

At this stage lianas were not more efficient in terms of light interception per unit mass (Φmass). In the fourth year lianas were mostly climbing and were taller relative to their mass, but exhibited lower buckling safety factors ({BSFs).} Their Φmass values became higher than those of the {LLP}, and equal to that of the {SLP}, Cecropia. The difference with the {LLP} was because the lianas captured more light per unit leaf area (Φarea) while they had a similar leaf area per unit mass ({LAR:} Φmass = {LAR} × Φarea). * {4These} results show that as lianas go from being freestanding to climbing, they improve their chances to harvest light at lower mass investments in above-ground parts than the {LLP} but not {SLP} trees.

Daily light interception per {individual\{Phi\}} d was calculated with a canopy model. The model was then used to estimate light interception per unit of leaf mass ({\{Phi\}leaf} mass), total above-ground mass ({\{Phi\}mass)} and crown structure efficiency (Ea, the ratio of absorbed vs. available light). {KEY} {RESULTS:} The {SLPs} Trema and Ochroma intercepted higher amounts of light per unit leaf mass ({\{Phi\}leaf} mass) because they had shallower crowns, resulting in higher crown use efficiency (Ea) than the other species. These {SLPs} (but not Cecropia) were also taller and intercepted more light per unit leaf area ({\{Phi\}area).} {LLPs} and lianas had considerably higher amounts of leaf mass and area per unit above-ground mass ({LMR} and {LAR}, respectively) and thus attained {\{Phi\}mass} values similar to the {SLPs} ({\{Phi\}mass=\{Phi\}areaxLAR).} Lianas, which were mostly self-supporting, had light interception efficiencies similar to those of the trees. {CONCLUSIONS:} These results show how, due to the trade-off between crown structure and biomass allocation, {SLPs}, and {LLPs} and lianas intercept similar amount of light per unit mass which may contribute to the ability of the latter two groups to persist.},

	abstract = {* {1We} related above-ground biomass allocation to light interception by trees and lianas growing in three tropical rain forest stands that were 0.5, 2 and 3-year-old regeneration stages after slash and burn agriculture. * {2Stem} height and diameter, leaf angle, the vertical distribution of total above-ground biomass and leaf longevity were measured in individuals of three short-lived pioneers ({SLP)}, four later successional species ({LS)} and three lianas (L). Daily light capture per individual (Φd) was calculated with a canopy model. Mean daily light interception per unit leaf area (Φarea), leaf mass (Φleaf mass) and above-ground mass (Φmass) were used as measures of instantaneous efficiency of biomass use for light capture. * {3With} increasing stand age, vegetation height and leaf area index increased while light at the forest floor declined from 34 to 5\%. The {SLP}, Trema micanthra and Ochroma pyramidale, dominated the canopy early in succession and became three times taller than the other species. {SLP} had lower leaf mass fractions and leaf area ratios than the other groups and this difference increased with stand age. * {4Over} time, the {SLP} intercepted increasingly more light per unit leaf mass than the other species. Lianas, which in the earliest stage were self-supporting and started climbing later on, gradually became taller at a given mass and diameter than the trees. Yet, they were not more efficient than trees in light interception. * {5SLP} had at least three-fold shorter leaf life spans than {LS} and lianas. Consequently, total light interception calculated over the mean life span of leaves (Φleaf mass total = Φarea × {SLAdeath} leaves× leaf longevity) was considerably lower for the {SLP} than for the other groups. * {6Synthesis.} We suggest that early dominance in secondary forest is associated with a high rate of leaf turnover which in turn causes inefficient long-term use of biomass for light capture, whereas persistence in the shade is associated with long leaf life spans. This analysis shows how inherent tradeoffs in crown and leaf traits drive long-term competition for light, and it presents a conceptual tool to explain why early dominants are not also the long-term dominants.},

	abstract = {The relationship between total leaf area ({LA)} and sapwood area ({SA)} was studied in four stands of approximately 30-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) representing extremes of stand basal area and site index. Nine trees (three dominant, three intermediate, and three suppressed) were randomly selected from each stand for determination of {LA} and {SA.} Sapwood permeability with respects to height in stem and radial distance from the pith was determined from one other tree from each dominance class in each stand. Stem cross-sectional {SA} at breast height, mid-stem and base of live crown were linearly related to {LA.} {SA} at the base of live crown was a better predictor of {LA} on some sites than {SA} at breast height. The effect of including sapwood permeability (averaged sapwood permeability x area of sapwood) in the {LA} prediction equations was minimal. Regression equations for {LA} had different slopes between basal area classes but not between sites. Because of the larger regression slope of the {LA} prediction from {SA} in the low basal area stands (more leaf area per unit of sapwood), it is hypothesized that carbohydrate production in low basal area stands is allocated proportionally more to leaf or root tissue than sapwood at breast height and mid-stem. This implies that leaf area is the controlling factor in the {LA-SA} relationship.},

	abstract = {How long forest trees can sustain wood production with increasing age remains an open question, primarily because whole-crown structure and growth cannot be readily measured from the ground or on felled trees. We climbed and directly measured crown structures and growth rates of 43 un-suppressed individuals (site trees) of the two tallest species – Eucalyptus regnans and Sequoia sempervirens – representing a wide range of tree sizes and ages. In both species, ground-level measurements of annual growth, including height, ring width, and basal area increment, exhibited the oft-reported trend of decreasing growth (or no change in growth) with age, yet wood production of the entire main trunk and whole crown both increased with size and age up to and including the largest and oldest trees we measured. The balance between structural metrics of whole-crown respiratory demands (cambium area, inner bark volume, sapwood volume, and heartwood deposition area) and photosynthetic capacity (leaf area and green bark area) was statistically independent of size but not age. After accounting for the effect of size, trees with lower potential respiratory demands grew more than trees with higher potential respiratory demands per unit photosynthetic area. The strongest determinant of tree energy balance was the ratio of aboveground cambium area to leaf area. Among the site trees we examined, over 85\% of the variation in annual wood production was explained by variation in size, and the proportion of total aboveground wood production in appendages (branches, limbs, and reiterated trunks) increased linearly with size. With increasing age in both species, the proportion of annual wood production converted to heartwood increased in main trunks and appendages. The oldest tree we measured produced more heartwood in its main trunk over 651 years (351\&\#xa0;m3) than contained in any tree we measured \&lt;1500 years old. The two tallest tree species achieve similar stature despite divergent growth dynamics and ecologies. At one extreme, E. regnans attains great size quickly but dies relatively young because trees are susceptible to fire and fungi. At the other extreme, S. sempervirens attains great size more slowly but has a long lifespan because trees resist fire and prioritize investment in decay-resistant heartwood. Increasing wood production as trees age is a mechanism underlying the maintenance of biomass accumulation during forest development and the carbon-sink capacity of old-growth forests.},

P. Laws) forest stand density has increased significantly over
the last century (Covington et al. 1997). To understand the effect
of increased intraspecific competition, tree size (height
and diameter at breast height ({DBH))} and leaf area to sapwood
area ratio ({AL:AS)} on water relations, we compared hydraulic
conductance from soil to leaf (kl) and transpiration per unit leaf
area ({QL)} of ponderosa pine trees in an unthinned plot to trees
in a thinned plot in the first and second years after thinning in a
dense Arizona {forest.We} calculated kl {andQL} based on wholetree
sap flux measured with heat dissipation sensors. Thinning
increased tree predawn water potential within two weeks of
treatment. Effects of thinning on kl and {QL} depended on {DBH},
{AL:AS} and drought severity. During severe drought in the first
growing season after thinning, kl and {QL} of trees with low
{AL:AS} (160–250 mm {DBH;} 9–11 m height) were lower in the
thinned plot than the unthinned plot, suggesting a reduction in
stomatal conductance (gs) or reduced sapwood specific conductivity
({KS)}, or both, in response to thinning. In contrast kl
and {QL} were similar in the thinned plot and unthinned plot for
trees with high {AL:AS} (260–360 mm {DBH;} 13–16 m height).
During non-drought periods, kl and {QL} were greater in the
thinned plot than in the unthinned plot for all but the largest
trees. Contrary to previous studies of ponderosa pine, {AL:AS}
was positively correlated with tree height and {DBH.} Furthermore,
kl and {QL} showed a weak negative correlation with tree
height and a strong negative correlation with {AS} and thus {AL:AS}
in both the thinned and unthinned plots, suggesting that trees
with high {AL:AS} had lower gs. Our results highlight the important
influence of stand competitive environment on tree-sizerelated
variation in {AL:AS} and the roles of {AL:AS} and drought
on whole-tree water relations in response to thinning.},

(Family Ulmaceae) has been reduced to shrub form because of frost. Only the aboveground biomass of H. integrifolia and other shrubs were estimated by destructive harvesting method. Herbaceous forest floor biomass and leaf litter fall were also estimated. The total forest vegetation biomass was {10.86\&\#xa0;Mg\&\#xa0;ha−1} in 2008 which increased to {19.49\&\#xa0;Mg\&\#xa0;ha−1} in 2009.

	abstract = {We examined the potential growth of clonal Eucalyptus plantations at eight locations across a 1000+ km gradient in Brazil by manipulating the supplies of nutrients and water, and altering the uniformity of tree sizes within plots. With no fertilization or irrigation, mean annual increments of stem wood were about 28\% lower ({16.2\&\#xa0;Mg\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1}, about 33\&\#xa0;m3\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1) than yields achieved with current operational rates of fertilization ({22.6\&\#xa0;Mg\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1}, about 46\&\#xa0;m3\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1). Fertilization beyond current operational rates did not increase growth, whereas irrigation raised growth by about 30\% (to {30.6\&\#xa0;Mg\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1}, about 62\&\#xa0;m3\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1). The potential biological productivity (current annual increment) of the plantations was about one-third greater than these values, if based only on the period after achieving full canopies. The biological potential productivity was even greater if based only on the full-canopy period during the wet season, indicating that the maximum biological productivity across the sites (with irrigation, during the wet season) would be about {42\&\#xa0;Mg\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1} (83\&\#xa0;m3\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;yr−1). Stands with uniform structure (trees in plots planted in a single day) showed 13\% greater growth than stands with higher heterogeneity of tree sizes (owing to a staggered planting time of up to 80 days). Higher water supply increased growth and also delayed by about 1 year the point where current annual increment and mean annual increment intersected, indicating opportunities for lengthening rotations for more productive treatments as well as the influence of year-to-year climate variations on optimal rotations periods. The growth response to treatments after canopy closure (mid-rotation) related well with full-rotation responses, offering an early opportunity for estimating whole-rotation yields. These results underscore the importance of resource supply, the efficiency of resource use, and stand uniformity in setting the bounds for productivity, and provide a baseline for evaluating the productivity achieved in operational plantations. The {BEPP} Project showed that water supply is the key resource determining levels of plantation productivity in Brazil. Future collaboration between scientists working on silviculture and genetics should lead to new insights on the mechanisms connecting water and growth, leading to improved matching of sites, clones, and silviculture.},

	abstract = {1 Monitoring of two canopy species Dicorynia guianensis and Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae) in a tropical rain forest in French Guiana was used to investigate vegetative crown development at five organizational levels: leaf, metamer, extension unit, sympodial unit and whole crown. The effects of light availability and tree height on different traits were evaluated in trees {\textless} 25 m in height and compared with taller individuals (25–37 m). Path-analysis is used to illustrate the consequences of trait changes at multiple levels of organization for the whole crown level.2 Tree height and canopy openness influenced crown development at each organizational level. Crowns in higher light levels had lower specific leaf area, greater leaf spacing, greater extension of all branches, and greater extension of the leader shoot. With increasing tree height, crowns had a lower specific leaf area, greater leaf area index and greater relative crown depth.3 Vouacapoua showed some responses to light not seen in Dicorynia. In particular, Vouacapoua increased meristem activity with light, but the lack of response in Dicorynia may be due to moderate light levels rather than inability to respond.4 Low leaf-display costs at low light availability may enable trees to survive light suppression.5 Light availability cannot explain trait changes with tree height. Alternative explanations for trait changes with tree height are discussed.6 Several of the relationships between plant traits and tree height or canopy openness became non-linear when taller trees (25–37 m) were included. In these taller trees, vegetative growth was reduced at all organizational levels, particularly in Vouacapoua, which does not grow as tall as Dicorynia.7 Qualitatively, plant responses to light did not differ between trees of different height, and were similar to seedling and sapling data in the literature. Responses were, however, quantitatively different, suggesting that small saplings cannot serve as model organisms for crown development in taller trees.},

Maximum aboveground accumulated tree biomass of E. grandis and E. pilularis was 394\&\#xa0;tonne\&\#xa0;ha−1 at 27 years of age and 270\&\#xa0;tonne\&\#xa0;ha−1 at 33 years of age respectively and there was a further 42 and 6.7\&\#xa0;tonne\&\#xa0;ha−1 respectively contained in the understorey. The estimated maximum current annual accumulation rate of tree biomass for E. grandis and E. pilularis was 16.4\&\#xa0;tonne\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;year−1 at 5 years of age and 15.7\&\#xa0;tonne\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;year−1 at 7 years of age, respectively, and maximum total aboveground net primary production ({NPP)} was 27.9 and 24.4\&\#xa0;tonne\&\#xa0;ha−1\&\#xa0;year−1, respectively. Total quantities of accumulated nutrients for E. grandis were much higher than for E. pilularis at comparable ages resulting from higher growth rates, higher tissue nutrient concentrations and different distributions of biomass components. The annual rate of nutrient accumulation for all nutrients reached a peak near the time of crown closure and then declined, the rate of decline differing between species. The annual rate of accumulation of nitrogen by the two species followed a very similar pattern but for all other nutrients was much lower for E. pilularis than for E. grandis. Nutrient requirement and uptake were higher for E. grandis than E. pilularis and however, reached a peak near crown closure in both species and then declined to a stable level in both species. Uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was lower than requirement in both species indicating nutrient redistribution, while for calcium and magnesium, uptake was higher than requirement. Although a relatively minor component of the total biomass, the understoreys were a significant component of nutrient cycling. This was due to the higher rate of turnover of biomass and higher concentrations of nutrients in understorey than in trees.},

	abstract = {The comparative phenotypic plasticity of 16 species of tropical rainforest shrubs (genus Psychotria, Rubiaceae) was investigated by growing plants in three light environments on Barro Colorado Island ({BCI}, Panama). The three light environments gave daily photon flux densities ({PPFD)} similar to the natural light gradient from shaded forest understory to small and large canopy gaps. Six of the species are principally found in gaps or forest edge environments, whereas the other ten species are principally found in shaded understories. Interactions between light treatment and species resulted in unpredictable mean phenotypic expression across light treatments. Shoot relative growth rates ({RGR)} were similar for understory and gap species in the low light treatment. Gap species had significantly greater shoot {RGR} in the intermediate light treatment than in the high light treatment. Mean plasticity was significantly lower for morphological variables when com pared to physiological variables, while variation in plasticity was significantly greater for structural variables. Significant differences between gap and understory species were found in the plasticity of six out of the seven variables. The mean phenotypic plasticity of the seven variables was significantly greater for gap than for understory species. The high plasticity of gap species was consistent with the hypothesis that specialization in a more favorable environment increases plasticity. The species exhibited a wide range of leaf longevities, from four to 29 months, with gap species having, on average, shorter leaf lifespan than understory species. Mean phenotypic plasticity decreased with increasing leaf longevity. Selection for greater plasticity may be stronger in the gap species because gaps exhibit a relatively predictable decrease in {PPFD} for which plasticity could be adaptive. While we have found a significant correlation between phenotypic plasticity and habitat affiliation, phylogeny (subgenus ascription) was not correlated with plasticity or with plant performance in any given {PPFD} treatment, reinforcing the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity has evolved through natural selection in this diverse genus.},

	abstract = {Secondary forests are a major terrestrial carbon sink and reliable estimates of their carbon stocks are pivotal for understanding the global carbon balance and initiatives to mitigate {CO2} emissions through forest management and reforestation. A common method to quantify carbon stocks in forests is the use of allometric regression models to convert forest inventory data to estimates of aboveground biomass ({AGB).} The use of allometric models implies decisions on the selection of extant models or the development of a local model, the predictor variables included in the selected model, and the number of trees and species for destructive biomass measurements. We assess uncertainties associated with these decisions using data from 94 secondary forest plots in central Panama and 244 harvested trees belonging to 26 locally abundant species. {AGB} estimates from species-specific models were used to assess relative errors of estimates from multispecies models. To reduce uncertainty in the estimation of plot {AGB}, including wood specific gravity ({WSG)} in the model was more important than the number of trees used for model fitting. However, decreasing the number of trees increased uncertainty of landscape-level {AGB} estimates substantially, while including {WSG} had limited effects on the accuracy of the landscape-level estimates. Predictions of stand and landscape {AGB} varied strongly among models, making model choice an important source of uncertainty. Local models provided more accurate {AGB} estimates than foreign models, but high variability in carbon stocks across the landscape implies that developing local models is only justified when landscape sampling is sufficiently intensive.},

	abstract = {It is generally believed that asymmetric competition for light plays a predominant role in determining the course of succession by increasing size inequalities between plants. Size-related growth is the product of size-related light capture and light-use efficiency ({LUE).} We have used a canopy model to calculate light capture and photosynthetic rates of pioneer species in sequential vegetation stages of a young secondary forest stand. Growth of the same saplings was followed in time as succession proceeded. Photosynthetic rate per unit plant mass (Pmass: mol C g−1 day−1), a proxy for plant growth, was calculated as the product of light capture efficiency [Φmass: mol photosynthetic photon flux density ({PPFD)} g−1 day−1] and {LUE} (mol C mol {PPFD−1).} Species showed different morphologies and photosynthetic characteristics, but their light-capturing and light-use efficiencies, and thus Pmass, did not differ much. This was also observed in the field: plant growth was not size-asymmetric. The size hierarchy that was present from the very early beginning of succession remained for at least the first 5 years. We conclude, therefore, that in slow-growing regenerating vegetation stands, the importance of asymmetric competition for light and growth can be much less than is often assumed.},

Foliage, branch, stem sapwood, heartwood and bark components of aboveground biomass were measured in 117 trees sampled from 17 stands varying in age, density and site fertility. A subsample of 32 trees was measured for belowground biomass excluding fine roots. Biomass of fine roots was estimated from the results of an earlier study. Statistical models were constructed to predict dry mass ({DW)} of components from tree height and basal area, and time derivatives of these models were used to estimate biomass increments from height growth and basal area growth. Biomass growth (G) was estimated by adding estimated biomass turnover rates to increments, and gross photosynthetic production (P) was estimated by adding estimated component respiration rates to growth. The method, which predicts the time course of G, P and biomass increment in individual trees as functions of height growth and basal area growth, was applied to eight example trees representing different dominance positions and site fertilities. Estimated G and P of the example trees varied with competition, site fertility and tree height, reaching maximum values of 22 and 43 kg({DW)} year(-1), respectively. The site types did not show marked differences in productivity of trees of the same height, although height growth was greater on the fertile site. The {G:P} ratio decreased with tree height from 65 to 45\%. Growth allocation to needles and branches increased with increasing dominance, whereas growth allocation to the stem decreased. Growth allocation to branches decreased and growth allocation to coarse roots increased with increasing tree size. Trees at the poor site allocated 49\% more to fine roots than trees at the fertile site. The belowground parts accounted for 25 to 55\% of annual G, increasing with tree size and decreasing with site fertility. Annual G and P per unit needle mass varied over the ranges 1.9-2.4 and 3.5-4.0 kg({DW)} kg(-1), respectively.

	abstract = {A chronosequence of Populus tremuloides Michx. stands ranging from 5 to 95 years of age was measured to document changes on aboveground biomass and nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) contents for three site classes (good, medium and poor) in the Boreal White and Black Spruce ({BWBS)} zone in northeastern British Columbia. Allometric equations relating dry weights of stemwood, branches and leaves to tree diameter at breast height were developed to estimate aboveground tree biomass. Total aboveground tree biomass increased with stand age from 34.8 t ha−1 in the 5-year-old stand to 359.7 t ha−1 in the 95-year-old stand on good sites, and from 8.3 t ha−1 to 267.7 t ha−1, respectively, on medium sites. On poor sites, the total aboveground tree biomass ranged from 33.9 t ha−1 in a 15-year-old stand to 245.4 t ha−1 in a 95-year-old stand. As stands aged, an increasing proportion of the aboveground biomass was allocated to stems.

Nutrient accumulation in aboveground tree biomass increased with stand age and was in the order of N \&gt; Ca \&gt; K \&gt; Mg \&gt; P. Temporal patterns of nutrient accumulation followed the pattern of aboveground biomass accumulation. The nutrient concentrations in different tree tissues decreased in the order leaf \&gt; branch \&gt; stembark \&gt; stemwood, except for K. Understory vegetation contributed little to the nutrient pool of aspen ecosystems. Mineral soil contained the greatest proportion of nutrient capital of the various ecosystem components.},

	abstract = {The aboveground biomass and nutrient content (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) of stands of Betula papyrifera Marsh, aged 2, 8, 15, 45, 60, 75 years were measured in the Thompson Moist Warm Interior Cedar Hemlock variant ({ICHmw3)} of the southern interior of British Columbia. For four of these ages (2, 8, 60 and 75 years) measurements were made on good, medium and poor sites. For the other two ages, only stands on good sites coulde be located. Allometric equations relating dry weights of stemwood, stembark, branches and leaves to tree diameter at breast height ({DBH)} were developed to estimate aboveground tree biomass. Equations were not significantly different among the three site qualities. Average total aboveground tree biomass for all sites increased with stand age from 1.4 t ha−1 in 2-year-old stands (varying from 0.45 to 2.1 t ha−1 on poor and good sites, respectively) to 202 t ha−1 in the 75-year-old stand (156 and 234 t ha−1 on poor and good sites, respectively). As stand age increased, an increasing proportion of annual biomass increment was allocated to stems, but nutrients were preferentially accumulated in the leaves. Nutrient content of aboveground tree biomass increased with stand age and was generally in the order of N \&gt; Ca \&gt; K \&gt; Mg \&gt; P. Average rates of nutrients accumulation in biomass were greatest in the early stages of stand development, and less marked as stands aged. The concentrations of nutrients in tissues decreased in the following order: leaf \&gt; branch \&gt; stembark \&gt; stemwood. Understory minor vegetation contributed little to the nutrient pool of these paper birch ecosystems. Mineral soil contained the largest amount of nutrients among the various ecosystem components.},

Paper birch, which formed the dominant overstory following the 1961 fire, had normal distributions of height and diameter classes. Subalpine fir, which dominated the understory, had the reverse J-shaped height and diameter distributions that are expected of a shade tolerant, climax species. Paper birch grew more than three times the height of subalpine fir. Growing in the summer shade of the birch, subalpine fir had slow but steady height growth during the first 10–15 years, after which height growth declined somewhat. Allometric equations, relating dry weight of foliage, branches, stemwood, stembark, roots, and total biomass to diameter at breast height ({DBH)}, were developed to estimate above- and below-ground biomass. Total biomass of paper birch reached 83.2 t ha−1, while subalpine fir biomass was 26.7 t ha−1. Subalpine fir allocated more biomass to foliage and branches compared to paper birch. Foliage of paper birch had higher nutrient concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg than subalpine fir foliage. Branches and stembark of subalpine fir had higher P, and Ca concentrations than paper birch. Subalpine fir branches contained more of all examined nutrients than paper birch branches. This is a significant component in nutrient cycling of the mixed-species forest.},

We applied the pipe model theory to the analysis of several western coniferous species to learn whether the distribution of canopy leaf area could be accurately estimated from knowledge of the sapwood cross-sectional area at various heights, including breast height (1.37 m). Results are excellent, but taper in the conducting area must be considered when sapwood area is measured below the crown.},

In the {FG}, the biomass ratio of branch to stem reached a maximum of 1.54 at age 12 and then declined and fluctuated around 0.69.

	abstract = {Abstract1. Interspecific comparisons were made among Scaphium species (Sterculiaceae): S. borneense (Merr.) Kosterm., S. longipetiolatum (Kosterm.) Kostermans, and S. macropodum (Miq.) Beumee ex Heyne to test the hypothesis that variations in their architecture and allometry are related to the microhabitat conditions of stands where the species regenerate preferentially. 2. The species studied are shade-tolerant canopy trees. They occur in a tropical rainforest in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, East Malaysia (sympatric at the community level), where the study was conducted, but show an allopatric pattern of distribution among microhabitats due to localized edaphic conditions. Scaphium longipetiolatum occurs primarily in stands on clay-rich soils, whereas S. borneense occurs primarily in stands on sandy soils. Stands on clay-rich soils are more shaded, and gaps form less frequently than in stands on sandy soils. 3. Scaphium longipetiolatum initiated branching at a smaller tree size than S. borneense and S. macropodum, which did not produce branches until stems reached several centimeters in diameter. 4. The monoaxial saplings of S. borneense and S. macropodum expanded their crown area by producing bigger leaves. The branched saplings of S. longipetiolatum expanded their crown area by developing lateral branch systems. 5. An analysis of interspecific differences in above-ground allometries revealed that the growth pattern of monoaxial saplings, which emphasizes leader growth, leads to rapid height growth. In contrast, that of the branching saplings of S. longipetiolatum prioritizes shade tolerance. 6. The architecture and allometry of each Scaphium species gave some potential advantage over the other Scaphium species in stands where the former regenerates preferentially, that is, the advantages of each phenotype were context-dependent.

Saplings and poles shorter than 12 m in height had no branches, and gathered their leaves at the ends of the stem. The leaves changed from entire to palmately-parted with increasing tree size. The parted leaves increased the light penetration through the clustered foliage. The size of leaves including the blade and petiole ranged from 22 cm to 147 cm. Because the weight of petiole per blade increased with leaf size, the leaf could not be enlarged infinitely. Taller trees with lateral branches bore small (about 40 cm in length) entire leaves. The light intensity in the forest increased from the ground to about 12 m tall and was nearly constant from 12 m to 18 m. Crown architecture of S. macropodum adapted to this light environment. The monoaxial trees lower than 12 m could thus increase the amount of light with vertical elongation, and the branched trees higher than 12 m could increase it by means of lateral extension of crown area.},

The biomass of smaller plants ({DBH} \&lt 4.5 cm) was estimated by harvesting the plants in small quadrat plots. Although large differences were found between aboveground-biomass-estimates in different patches of different growth stages, the aboveground biomass in a 1.0 ha plot was 509 t/ha, and the one-sided {LAI} was 7.3 ha/ha. These values seem to result from the tall forest architecture with huge emergent trees (over 70 m high) and a moderate packing of plant mass indicated by the basal area value of 38.8 m⁲/ha for trees with {DBH} ≥ 4.5 cm.},

	abstract = {Eucalyptus plantations are extensively managed for wood production in the central highlands of Ethiopia. Nevertheless, little is known about their biomass (dry matter) production, partitioning and dynamics over time. Data from 10 different Eucalyptus globulus stands, with a plantation age ranging from 11 to 60 years and with a coppice-shoot age ranging from 1 to 9 years were collected and analyzed. Above-ground tree biomass of 7–10 sampled trees per stand was determined destructively. Dry weights of tree components (Wc; leaves, twigs, branches, stembark, and stemwood) and total above-ground biomass (Wa) were estimated as a function of diameter above stump (D), tree height (H) and a combination of these. The best fits were obtained, using combinations of D and H. When only one explanatory variable was used, D performed better than H. Total above-ground biomass was linearly related to coppice-shoot age. In contrast a negative relation was observed between the above-ground biomass production and total plantation age (number of cutting cycles). Total above-ground biomass increased from 11\&\#xa0;t\&\#xa0;ha−1 at a stand age of 1 year to 153\&\#xa0;t\&\#xa0;ha−1 at 9 years. The highest dry weight was allocated to stemwood and decreased in the following order: stemwood\&\#xa0;\&gt;\&\#xa0;leaves\&\#xa0;\&gt;\&\#xa0;stembark\&\#xa0;\&gt;\&\#xa0;twigs\&\#xa0;\&gt;\&\#xa0;branches. The equations developed in this study to estimate biomass components can be applied to other Eucalyptus plantations under the assumption that the populations being studied are similar with regard to density and tree size to those for which the relationships were developed.},
